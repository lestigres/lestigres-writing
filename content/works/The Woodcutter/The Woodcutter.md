  “You have guests come to stay often?” you continued, slowly and quietly, your
  body now drifting toward Abby's ever so slowly, your hooded eyes matching her
  own, lust playing obviously across both your features.


  “It's been a while, actually,” she purred, her voice becoming low and
  gravelly, barely above a whisper.


  She was looking at you hungrily like she was ready to devour you, as your body
  inched closer and closer.

  Abby Anderson is a management consultant for FFL&Y, and Isaac of Washington
  Liberty Financial is her major client. She retreats to her cabin in Vermont
  with her dog Bear, where she relaxes by chopping wood, and doing woodcrafts.


  Reader has just taken a contract at FFL&Y to fund their passion for
  printmaking, and they hope to do their first major exhibition later this year.
  They are staying at a family friend's cabin on the other side of the mountain,
  and come across Abby while lost in bad weather.


  The two connect immediately, but will they be able to keep their professional
  and personal lives separate, and will Abby be able to keep her need for
  control in check?

## Old Growth

The light was rapidly descending through the trees towards the horizon, and the temperature was dropping by the minute. You had been walking in circles for about half an hour, and the warm sun that had shone down on your face when you left for your hike a few hours ago, giving you a false sense of warmth, was going to be gone in no time.

*Where the hell was the trail?* you thought, frustrated.

It was Sunday, and you had spent most of the day looking at your carving materials, fighting a creative block. So, you decided to get some nature time in. But you had left it way too late in the afternoon to head out for a big hike, and here you were, somewhere between five (or maybe seven, by the way your calves hurt) miles from your cabin, completely disoriented, and ever-so-slightly panicking. You pulled the tube of your hydration bladder out of the clip on your backpack strap and took a drink while you figured out what to do.

*Calm down*, you thought. *You just need to find some waypoint to walk towards, and then ask for help*.

*Cool cool cool, no probs at all seeing as you’ve seen literally nothing other than forest for the last two hours*, your own anxiety responded.

"That’s just unhelpful right now," you muttered aloud, rolling your eyes at yourself.

*Check your phone for reception. Maybe it’s picked some up now you’re on the ridge line?* you said, attempting to reassure yourself.

You pulled your cellphone out of your pocket, but the 'No signal' icon glared unhelpfully back at you.

"FUCK!" you huffed aloud, scrunching up your eyes in frustration.

"Ok ok, it’s cool, just look around for some sign of human inhabitance," you tried to say coolly, raising your hand to block the glare from your eyes as you slowly scanned the dense pine all around. Low fog hung in the valley south of you.

You drummed your fingertips on your thigh and scanned towards the west, grinding your teeth as your breath turned into fog in front of your face.

*Wait, was that…?* You held your breath so it wouldn’t obscure your vision, and strained your eyes in the dim light of dusk.

"Smoke!" you yelled, exalted, pumping your fists in the air. A thin column of grey was rising from the northern side of the mountain. You couldn’t exactly see where it was coming from, but you guessed it was maybe a mile or so away? If you hustled, you might be able to make it there before the light disappeared. You set off towards the source of the smoke plume, your calves aching, and your muscles starting to tense as the cold dusk continued to set in.

You had arrived at your cabin on Friday afternoon, spent most of Saturday unpacking all your art materials and tools, and filling the pantry and fridge with food for the coming weeks. This was going to be your year, you were sure of it: the year you would finally turn your printmaking hobby into a career as an artist. After a summer residency at an artists’ retreat outside Chicago, you had moved back to Boston where you had contacts in the management consulting industry who you could freelance for as a designer. The work was usually pretty dry, but consulting money was good, and the nature of the work meant you could take time between contracts to get out to the cabin in Vermont that your family friends the Williamses were letting you use for the year. You and Ellie Williams had grown up together in the suburbs of Belmont, Massachusetts, taking turns to stay at each other’s family cabins each summer and winter holidays. Ellie and her partner Dina had just had a kid, and Ellie’s parents had gone off on a round-the-world trip for the year—so when you’d said you were moving back to Boston, they’d generously suggested you house-sit their home in Belmont, and use their Vermont cabin as your studio.

The cabin was about a 3-hour drive from Boston in the Land Rover. It was a long commute to get back to the city to start your new project tomorrow, but you’d wanted to get everything set up so you could come out next weekend and start working on the series of woodblock prints that were going to form your first solo exhibition at a gallery in downtown Boston sometime in the next 12 months. It was only a medium-sized gallery, but the curator seemed to have contacts with several of the big national galleries—so even though you’d have to pay a massive deposit to secure the venue exclusively, if even one big name in the art world loved your work, it might be mean you could go full-time with printmaking. It was all a bit terrifying, and everything had to go right—but if everything worked out the way it was supposed to, it was going to be your breakout year.

You shook your head to interrupt your reverie and pulled on the thick hood of your puffer jacket, zipping it up all the way so the collar covered your chin. It was only early October, but the cold had come early this year. Was that a freezing drop of rain on your cheek? You quickened your pace and tucked your hands into the pockets of your jacket, balling them into fists to keep in the warmth.

*Where the fuck did that smoke plume go?* You paused to peer anxiously through the pines and the icy rain now falling in earnest in the dim twilight and managed to locate the now-larger column of smoke rising from a chimney way off in the distance, lower on the mountain. You picked up the pace again as more icy cold drops of sleet fell on your face.

Five minutes later, you could make out a warm glow from inside a large, A-frame log cabin with a dark green roof. The last shards of sunlight were barely peeking over the horizon, and the temperature had almost certainly dropped below freezing.

As you walked towards the cabin, brushing the sleet off your puffer jacket with your freezing hand, you saw a tall, broad figure heaving an axe through the air to split an enormous piece of wood. The light from the cabin illuminated their silhouette, which was facing towards the cabin.

They kicked the remnants of wood off to the side with their boot and placed another log in front of them to split, wiping their brow with their free hand as they exhaled a puff of hot air into the twilight. Raising the axe with both hands again, the figure swung it with force through the air and cleft the log in two before repositioning the fragments and swinging the axe once more, the dull *chk* sound of wood breaking through the static of the sleet now pattering heavily on the ground.

You paused, staring at the hulking figure before you as they bent to move the wood around to continue splitting. You were close enough now to see the thickness of their butt and thighs in chocolate brown khakis and muddy, thick-soled Timberlands on their feet. You also noted with awe their muscled shoulders straining at the green and blue plaid shirt they wore, a navy blue puffer vest with a high collar over the top to protect their torso from the cold. A brown leather baseball cap with ear flaps sat snugly over their ears, and brown leather work gloves wrapped around the handle of the axe.

You panicked a little. What if this huge figure was some kind of literal axe murderer who lived in the remote wilderness waiting for hapless printmakers to wander across their path?

And then as they bent down to move the last pieces of firewood to the woodpile, you saw it: protruding from the back of their cap, a long, blonde braid of hair fell over their left shoulder.

You slowly let out a hot breath into the icy air as your brain went kinda foggy. Jesus fucking christ. Was this a woman?!

You were snapped out of your reverie by two loud barks from a dog that had appeared on the stoop of the cabin door. The woman effortlessly swung the heavy axe over her right shoulder, draping her hand off the end of the handle as leverage, and turned towards the dog.

"What’s up Bear? Is it dinner time?" you heard a woman’s voice call towards the dog. Wagging his tail, the dog leapt off the stoop in the direction of the lumberjane and bounded past her, straight towards you.

She followed the dog’s path and saw you standing under the pines by the edge of the clearing, looking slightly alarmed as the enormous black dog ran towards you.

"Bear! Come!" she yelled loudly and authoritatively into the night.

The dog immediately stopped, looked back at her, and whined.

"I said come!" she yelled again.

The dog looked back at you and then turned and trotted to the woman’s side. She crouched down to scratch his head with a "Good boy, good Bear," before she raised herself up to her full height and walked towards you, the axe over her shoulder again.

You didn’t really know what to do. You flashed an awkward, slightly confused smile, waved clumsily, and jogged towards them. She stopped a few feet away from you, but the dog immediately circled you enthusiastically, sniffing at your feet and legs.

"Hey! Uh, sorry, I didn’t mean to scare your dog!" you called apologetically at her.

"Bear, down!" she laughed at his excitement, clicking her fingers so that the dog backed away. She smirked and shook her head in amusement.

"Sorry, he’s not normally this friendly with strangers. This is Bear—” she gestured towards the dog, "—and I’m Abby." She leaned forward and reached out her hand to shake yours.

"Hey Bear, hey Abby, it’s nice to meet you," you grinned, returning the handshake and feeling her large hand dwarf yours. Despite the icy weather, her palm was warm. Her grip was firm and strong, and she lingered with her hand enveloping yours while her steely blue eyes sparkled at you.

It was like the universe paused for a moment. You could see her better now, in the light shining from the cabin. Her right eyebrow arched as her eyes lingered on your face. You saw her glance up and down your frame, and the corner of her mouth curved upward a little, her eyelids heavier. You smiled back, your mouth dropping open slightly, a little breathless all of a sudden. She lightly bit her bottom lip with her teeth in a way that was way sexier than it logically should have been, and you gulped. She chuckled under her breath as she let go of your hand, seeing the effect she was having on you.

Bear sat obediently at Abby’s feet, looking between you and Abby. Suddenly, you became aware that you were freezing. You shivered, rubbing your hands against your arms for warmth.

"Oh, sorry, shit—you must be freezing. Where on earth did you come from? There’s nothing round here for miles. Do you wanna come inside and warm up?" she asked, turning towards the cabin and gesturing for you to follow.

You nodded emphatically. "Yeah, that would be great actually," you said, through properly chattering teeth.

Abby opened the door, and Bear dashed in ahead of her. She placed the axe on a mount by the front door and stretched out her arm to hold the door for you, ushering you inside.

The front door clicked shut behind you, sealing out the cold.

"Do you want me to put your backpack and jacket in the drying room?" she offered.

"Oh yeah, thanks," you said, handing over your bag before unzipping your puffer and shrugging it off your shoulders. She took it from you and disappeared through a door to her left.

While she busied herself in the drying room, you walked slowly around the room and took in your surroundings. It was a spacious log cabin with high vaulted ceilings, open beams giving it a cozy, rustic ambiance. Floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides of the living space overlooked the now-dark forest outside, and the icy rain pattered heavily on the windowpanes.

To the other side of the room was an open plan kitchen with wooden cabinets and a long counter, and behind it towards the back of the room, a dining area with several bare, oversized lightbulbs glowing warmly above the dining table. The entire wall behind the table was a massive, built-in bookshelf, with both old and new-looking books neatly arranged, and interesting trinkets scattered amongst them.

The lounge was lit by a few lamps and a fireplace on the far wall that cracked and hissed, creating a welcoming hearth in front of a heavy oak coffee table that sat atop a plush, patterned rug. The coffee table was surrounded by a large leather chesterfield sofa and armchairs. Blankets were strewn artfully over the back of the sofa and chairs, and Bear had already snuggled down in his dog bed near the fire, cuddling up to a toy shark and chewing on an antler.

Abby emerged from the drying room, hat and gloves now gone, and one hand in the pocket of her vest. She followed you with her eyes as you looked around.

"Please make yourself comfy," she said, walking towards the kitchen. "Do you want something warm to drink? Coffee? Cocoa? Whiskey? I normally have a glass of something after I finish with the woodpile," she added, pulling down a bottle from the shelf above the counter.

"Whiskey would be great, actually," you nodded enthusiastically, before turning towards the fireplace and holding your hands to its heat to warm them up.

"Ok. Rocks or neat?" she called to you across the room as she busied herself in the kitchen.

"Uhhh, neat."

"Cool, coming right up." She flashed an effortless smile at you again as she reached up to grab some glasses.

You stepped back from the fire, and trailed your fingertips over the soft leather of the chesterfield sofa, sitting down and taking in the warm ambiance of the fire. Abby joined you a few moments later, setting down an expensive-looking etched crystal glass of whiskey in front of you before moving towards one of the armchairs, unbuttoning the cuffs of her plaid shirt, and rolling them up to her elbows.

She picked up her own glass from the small table beside her and rested it on the padded leather arm of the chair, leaning back comfortably while her other hand stretched behind her to rub the back of her neck and right shoulder. She closed her eyes as she did so, and you noticed her long, blonde eyelashes and the light of the fire dancing across her face.

Slowly blinking her eyelids open, she caught you looking at her, the expression on her soft lips indecipherable as she stared back at you, eyebrow raised slightly.

You blinked and looked away, embarrassed, feeling a flush of head in your cheeks and a pleasant warmth in your core. You reached forward to pick up the whiskey. It was smooth and oaky, and burned your throat pleasantly as it went down.

"So, what were you doing out in this weather?" she asked, raising her glass to take a sip, her eyes fixing on you.

You chuckled a little. "I just moved back to Boston from Chicago, but I'm going to be spending some time out this way."

"Cool, whereabouts? There aren't many places you can walk to from here."

"I'm at a little cabin on the south side of the mountain," you replied.

"The Williams place?" Her eyebrows raised in surprise, and she looked impressed. "That's a pretty good walk from here."

"Yeahhhh, I uhhh… kinda lost my way. I got distracted looking at the trees on the north crest of the ridge line. I got turned about and forgot which path I came up from. I shouldn't have even been up that far—I left the cabin way too late. Felt like I was walking in circles until I saw the smoke from your chimney."

"Well, glad Bear and I could help you out. It's really coming down out there now." She looked towards the windows, the sleet now hammering against the glass, which was starting to fog in places.

"Being stuck out there would not have been fun at all," you said relieved, taking another sip. "So you live out here full time?"

"Nah, I work in the city—Boston, I mean," she clarified. "But I like to get out here whenever I can. I bought this place a few years back, and Bear loves running through the woods. Well, me too, I guess—I prefer the trees to people," she smirked, a tiny flash of self-consciousness playing across her smile for a moment.

Your eyes met, and you smirked along with her. The tip of her tongue pressed against her teeth, and she brought the glass back up to her full lips to take another sip.

"Bear and I were about to make some dinner—vegetable pasta—do you want to join us to eat?"

At the idea of food, your tummy rumbled, and you grimaced at her gratefully. "That would be amazing, actually. I didn't realize how hungry I was."

"Sure thing, let me go sort us out," she smiled back, warmth in her eyes. "I can give you a lift back to the Williams's place after if you like?"

"Thank you so much," you called after her earnestly, and then looking towards her you noticed how tight her butt and thighs were in her khakis as she walked to the kitchen. You bit your lip, blinking your eyes a few times. How the heck were you sitting in the cozy designer cabin of this tanky blonde woman who was serving you whiskey and making you dinner? You looked around the cabin again, shaking your head in disbelief.

A few minutes later, she returned to the lounge with two bowls of steaming pasta laden with zucchini, squash, carrots and a tomato-based sauce. She handed a bowl to you and placed the other one down in front of Bear, who sat twitching until she gave the signal he could eat, at which point he hoovered the whole thing up immediately.

"Bear, manners!" she scolded him, making you laugh.

"He's so sweet. What breed is he?"

She walked back to the kitchen to grab her pasta. "A black German Shepherd—a rescue," she responded. "My family's kept sheps for generations, but black sheps like Bear are pretty rare. He was a scrawny, cheeky little guy when I first got him, but we fed him up pretty good, didn't we Bear?" she said, returning to the armchair with her food.

Bear, already having finished his dinner, came over to Abby and stood in front of her, tongue out, and Abby gave him playful pats all over his head. He looked at her dotingly.

You chatted about dogs while you ate dinner, and then Abby stood up, taking all three bowls to the kitchen, and began loading them into the dishwasher.

Lightning flashed behind the expansive windows to your right, and a deep rumbling of thunder followed moments later. You stood up with your whiskey and walked towards the windows to see how bad the storm was. Icy rain continued to hammer loudly at the glass, gusts of wind rattling the panes.

"Damn," you sighed quietly to yourself, leaning your butt against the back of the armchair and scrunching up your face in concern.

Abby appeared beside you with her drink, idly tapping against her glass with her index finger. Bear followed and stood beside her, leaning into Abby's leg. A crack of thunder echoed across the night. Bear looked up at her, his ears back a little. She scratched his head soothingly, reassuring him.

"The weather is getting worse," you sighed, your eyebrows furrowed in dismay.

She didn't respond immediately and looked like she was thinking something over.

"So, look," she began slowly, a slightly serious look on her face. She paused for a few moments and stared at her glass before turning to look at you. "I can drive you home if you want—but there are no lights down to the main road, it's windy as heck, and the visibility's pretty bad at this point, so—it's probably not super safe…" her voice trailed off. She gave you an apologetic sort of look, and you nodded in resignation.

She paused, taking a deep breath before continuing.

"This might be a bit weird, but, like—it's okay for you to stay here." Her eyes flashed briefly to yours. "I mean, Bear seems to like you, and there are two spare rooms, and you know the Williamses, so the chances of you being a serial killer are *pretty* low—" you both chuckled at her joke, "—and look, if you were a serial killer, I have a feeling I'd *probably* be able to overpower you anyway…" She cocked her eyebrow at you again and flexed her right arm deliberately behind her head again, a smug smile on her face as she watched you watching the muscles and veins in her forearm tense, and her shirt strain under the thickness of her biceps.

*Jeezus*, you thought. *She's hot and built AND she knows it*. Your mouth gaped slightly, a hot breath escaping your lips and your center burning red hot as you thought about what she could do with those muscles.

She flashed a smile like she knew exactly what you were thinking about, her blue eyes fixing on yours again, that cocky-AF eyebrow arched, the tip of her tongue running slowly along her teeth.

Something had shifted between the two of you, and a low tension thrummed deliciously below your hips.

"Well, as long as Bear's alright with it…" you said slowly, taking the opportunity to bend down and give Bear big scritches on the sides of his face, your eyes glancing up at her briefly as you did so.

Abby watched you quietly, another indecipherable look playing across her eyes. Bear wagged his tail at you enthusiastically and pushed his head more firmly into your pats before wandering back to his cozy bed by the fire.

"Damn, he really likes you, huh? You must have the magic touch."

She left her sentence hanging before continuing, speaking slowly and deliberately, as you stood upright.

"He normally loses it when I have a guest come to stay." She cocked her head to one side, and her braid fell over her shoulder.

You turned your head to look at her, lips parted, and her eyes narrowed just a little and bore into your own, the weight of her inference hanging heavily between you. She leaned into the back of the chesterfield, head tilting back slightly, accentuating her jawline. Her eyes continued to hold your gaze intently as she took a sip from her glass again, as if daring you to make the next move.

"Is that right?" you quizzed softly, and she nodded, barely perceptibly, and one corner of those full lips pulled into a tiny smirk that was utterly confident, self-assured, and so completely sexy that you felt the tension between your thighs thrum more insistently.

"You have guests come to stay often?" you continued, slowly and quietly, your body now drifting toward hers ever so slowly, your hooded eyes matching her own, lust playing obviously across both your features.

"It's been a while, actually," she purred, her voice becoming low and gravelly, barely above a whisper.

She was looking at you hungrily like she was ready to devour you, as your body inched closer and closer.

You could feel your hot breath brushing slowly and heavily against your lips, as you looked from her eyes to her mouth and back to her eyes again, where they locked on hers.

You were both frozen in suspended motion, your faces inches apart from one another. Her eyes narrowed further, and she bit her lip, her chest rising and falling visibly with the intensity of her heavy breaths. Her warm hands moved slowly to your waist, gently tugging your body forward and pulling your lips to meet hers.

## Against The Grain

<aside>
<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>Your want for one another hung in the air between you, mouths slightly open, chests rising and falling intensely. Her hot, shallow breaths matched the sounds of your own. You were each waiting, expectantly, daring the other to cave first. It was like an invisible force was holding each of you back, the anticipation of what was about to transpire building palpably.
“I can’t wait to watch you fall apart for me,” she breathed, and it was half desire, half promise.
--
Abby delights in taking you apart piece by piece, and loves the ways in which you don't fully pander to her sexy, toppy energy.
You're relishing in the best one night stand you've had in a while—but it feels like there could be more to this than just a deliciously hot fuck.</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>This is the first smut I've written that I'm pretty happy with—I hope y'all enjoy it.
It's a little indulgent—almost 7000 words of pure smutty goodness (and a touch of fluff here and there)—but I really enjoyed the idea of Abby wrecking the reader painfully slowly over the course of the night (while still saving some juicy stuff for later chapters).
Comments and kudos are very welcome and motivating. TYSM!

</aside>

A log in the fireplace popped, crackled sharply and then faded with a quiet, drawn-out hiss. But you were oblivious to the fire, and to the loud *tap-tap-tap* of the freezing rain on the windows behind you.

Every sense in your body had focussed on precisely one single thing: Abby’s lips grazing gently over your own, her eyelids closed to reveal those dark blonde lashes once more.

She pulled her lips back from you, but only by millimetres. You could feel the warmth of her breath on your face as you took in one another’s features up close: her eyes were a steely blue, framed by those perpetually-arched and sexy-as-hell eyebrows. Freckles dotted her skin, particularly prominent on her nose and cheeks, and the strong line of her jaw was somehow soft at the edges, despite how obviously built she was. Most enticing, however, were her lips—the lower of which was luxuriously full and jutted out prominently when she was thinking, or looking smug, or most dangerously, when shooting you one of those self-assured, “*Hi, have you seen me? I’m hot, come fuck me*,” kind of looks. Which she had been doing quite a bit to you over the course of the evening.

She was breathing heavily, and you could feel feather-light puffs of hot air gracing your skin as you gently sought out the sensation of one another. She dragged her lower lip with aching delicacy over your cheek, just barely making contact with your skin. It was phenomenal to you how a person as physically powerful as Abby could simultaneously be so gentle; so soft.

She’d hooked her index fingers into the belt loops at either side of your waist, and was now pulling you gently but insistently towards her perch on the wide back of the of the chesterfield arm chair. She opened her knees wider to accommodate you in the space between her broad, muscular thighs, and then your body was almost flush with hers, her hands moving to the small of your back to hold you closer so she could kiss you more deeply.

You responded by moving your hands past the open puffer vest to her hips, where your thumbs began to rub softly through the flannel of her plaid shirt against each of her hipbones.

As the pads of your thumbs pressed against her, you made a sharp inhale as you felt the tautness of her well-defined abdomen. Your head pulled back from hers abruptly, eyes wide in disbelief as you looked towards where your hands touched her body, trying to make sense of what they were feeling. You pressed your fingertips more intently through the fabric against the tight, smooth flesh of her stomach, and felt sharp lines framing her abdominal muscles.

At this, your eyes flashed up to stare into hers, which were dark and intense, and heavily-lidded. One side of her upper lip was hitched into one of those indecent, self-assured smirks, matched by her eyebrow which was now smugly raised as if to say to you, “Yes, I really *am* that hot.”

She took advantage of the distraction to slide one of her hands carefully above the waist of your trousers, sneaking underneath your sweater and t-shirt to touch the skin there, and the warm pads of her fingers brushing lightly against you caused the place between your thighs to pulse. She trailed the fingertips of her other hand up the length of your sweater, pausing when she reached your chin to tilt it upwards with her index finger so you were looking directly into her eyes.

“Fuck…” you sighed, eyelids fluttering, head swimming, your voice just above a whisper as your gaze fixed on hers. She bit her lower lip into her mouth and pressed her forehead against yours, letting out a low, satisfied groan.

Your want for one another hung in the air between you, mouths slightly open, chests rising and falling intensely. Her hot, shallow breaths matched the sounds of your own. You were each waiting, expectantly, daring the other to cave first. It was like an invisible force was holding each of you back, the anticipation of what was about to transpire building palpably.

“I can’t wait to watch you fall apart for me,” she breathed, and it was half desire, half promise.

You dropped your chin to towards Abby’s hand as it played at your jawline, allowing your parted lips to fall into the path of one of her fingers, your eyes flickering to Abby’s as you did so, taunting her to respond.

She allowed the tip of her finger to drag along your bottom lip, and you moved your head slightly so as to catch the fingertip just inside your mouth. Her jaw slackened hotly in arousal, brows furrowed like she was fighting to conceal the effect you were having on her.

Then the look on her face shifted, her eyes serious in a look you couldn’t quite decipher. It was like she was trying to size you up; or trying make sense of what she was getting into, but she wasn’t certain; as if your behaviour had surprised her.

You took precisely this moment of vulnerability to fuck with her sense of control. Closing your teeth around her fingertip, you pulled your head back slowly so she would feel the warmth and wetness of your mouth as your teeth grazed against her finger. Her eyes met yours again, that delicious smirk reappearing like she was now ready to consume you.

And at that, Abby could no longer contain her lust for you. In the space of a second, she pulled you closer, a hand moving to the small of your back to tug your hips against hers, the other now at the back of your neck—and before you knew what had happened, she was kissing you.

Except this time, her kisses weren’t soft and teasing: there was an urgency in them, a need to satiate the desire that had ignited within her. She kissed you thoroughly, passionately; barely stopping for breaths, and pulling you closer still, fingernails at the curve of your back intermittently scraping and smoothing the skin there. And you were melting under her fevered hands and tongue; and your own hands were at her waist pulling her towards you; and you could feel the white-hot heat emanating from her body.

Her hand travelled downward to knead your butt with her palm, and you moaned audibly, your mouth falling open at the sensation. She took this opportunity to draw your lower lip sharply between her teeth and pull, a wicked look dancing across her eyes. The satisfying pain shot straight from your mouth to the heat pooling intensely somewhere below your stomach, and the sounds that were escaping your mouth in response caused her to eyes to snap shut briefly and a low grunt of pleasure to escape her throat through clenched teeth as she revelled in the effect she was having on you.

Her mouth now trailed across your cheek and towards your neck, the thumb of her right hand holding your head to one side so you couldn’t resist the nips of her teeth at your earlobe and the flesh around your neck.

You let out a small, needy whine.

In reply, her teeth raked harder against your flesh, turning your whine into a more insistent moan.

Fuck. This woman was something else. It was like she already knew how you liked to be touched; kissed; licked; bitten.

You felt her hand move from your butt and down the back of your leg to the crook of your knee, so she could hitch your leg up a little, and pull you up, over, and firmly down onto her own thickly-muscled thigh. Hands at your waist, she held you firmly, grinding your heat against her, as she continued to lave at your ear and neck with her mouth.

One of your hands snaked up her chest to her shoulders, feeling the tense muscles there before gripping against the back of her neck. This was partly just to relish in the strength of her—but also because, honestly, at this point, you legitimately needed something to hold on to. The feeling of her thigh pressing against your clit was making your knees weak, and you were so wet at this point that you were certain she could feel it through your trousers.

Almost as if she were reading your mind, she moved her head further back to relish in the pleasure written across your face, fixing her heavy-lidded eyes intently on your own.

“You look so fucking sexy right now.” Her voice was low and dripping with sex. She moved to press soft, wet kisses to the spot on your neck she’d been biting at moments earlier before pulling back to look hotly into your eyes. “You like how I feel against you, don’t you baby?”

You felt a low swoop in the space below your abdomen. *Jesus fucking christ.* You hadn’t expected such casual affection. She was making you an absolute mess for her.

“Mmmhmm, fuck, yes, you feel so good…” you breathed affirmatively, eyelids heavy. How was she unravelling you like this when you were fully clothed?

*Fuck, she is so sexy*, you thought. *What. The. Actual. Fuck.* How on earth did you only meet this woman like three hours ago?

The rain continued to thrum loudly outside, the fire flickering and crackling softly in the background over her shoulder. You were both breathing heavily, eyes transfixed on one another.

She bit her lip, eyes dark.

“So—if you’re ok with it…” she began slowly, and you were hanging on her every husky word— “I would really, *really* like…” she was pressing kisses to different spots on your neck— ”to remove your clothes…” soft kisses now landed at the edge of your jawline near your chin— ”and fuck you with my mouth…” she finished, her teeth sinking into the flesh of your neck.

Your eyes went wide with desire, and your cunt throbbed intensely against the thigh wedged firmly between your legs. But before you could answer, she kissed you deeply, your mouth melting into the warmth of her.

“Fuck, yes. Please. Definitely,” you answered, in a way that was almost pathetic. You were desperate to feel her skin against yours.

“Are you sure?” she continued, sincerity in her eyes. "’Cause if you wanna stop at any time, say the word, ok?” she finished, with a sweet, reassuring nod.

“Abby?” you started, kissing her lips roughly, your eyes narrowed in seriousness, but your breathing shallow—because, how she could even make *consent* sound sexy?

“Yeah?” Her eyebrows were furrowed, and she was listening to you attentively, making sure she wasn’t moving too fast. Her fingers tangled through your hair as her thumb rubbed softly at the divot of skin just below your ear.

She was being so goddamned sweet and sincere that you felt an unexpected pang of tenderness for this completely surprising woman with magically strong lumberjack hands and perfectly sumptuous lips—who just happened to *also* be very considerate in the bedroom. How was she even *real*?

“Shut up and fuck me,” you breathed out, your desperate need for her evident in your words.

And that clearly did something to her, because her eyes flashed with a darkness that you hadn’t seen until now, and the sound that erupted from deep in her throat was almost animalistic: a low, hungry, breathy groan that sent waves of pleasure directly to your cunt.

And before you knew what was happening, she bent to scoop you up effortlessly with her hands, pulled your legs up around her hips, and then turned you both 180 degrees and deposited you on the broad, flat backrest of the arm chair she’d been leaning against only moments earlier.

Your eyebrows raised, impressed at this easy display of strength—but she just smiled that wickedly-enticing lopsided grin in smug satisfaction. You placed your hands either side of you on the sturdy leather upholstery, and leaned back slightly, inviting her towards you with your eyes.

You saw a flash of her teeth between her lips, and she came to kiss your neck and mouth once again. Her left hand slid beneath your shirt to support the small of your back, while her right hand began feeling its way up your stomach toward your chest. Her large hands felt warm on you, with rough callouses in places—*from the axe?*, you guessed—but even with all that power, she wielded them softly, meticulously; applying *just* the right amount of intensity that made you feel oh so good…

“Mmmmmh… your body feels fucking incredible,” she mused. She was clearly enjoying all of this as much as you were.

Her hand continued to climb further up your chest, stopping just shy of your nipples. She kneaded the flesh there with slow, firm pressure, as you arched your chest into her hands, and when her thumb brush against your nipple, you felt your sex pulse hotly with your need for her.

“Does that feel good?” she breathed softly, looking into your eyes. You nodded, and she continued working the hard nub with her thumb and the tip of her index finger, while her mouth moved to kiss you, tongue flicking lightly at your lips.

“How about now?” she quizzed, squeezing the flesh of your nipple between her thumb and forefinger for just a second. You inhaled sharply through your teeth as a hot bolt of pleasure lurched within your abdomen.

“Fuck—Abby, yessss, that feels so good…” you moaned in reply, and your head fell backward, inviting her to land further kisses at your neck, dragging her teeth intermittently along your skin while she moved to brush your other nipple, giving it a flick now and then to draw soft moans from you that she seemed to revel in. You sighed in ecstasy, the contrasting pleasure and pain making your head swim.

She kissed her way down from your neck, to your collarbone, and then past the centre of your chest, pulling her hands away from your nipples as she went, and you let out a small, whiny pant.

She just chuckled at you, her eyes fixing you with a look of mock-pity.

“Oh, baby, you’re so needy for me,” she purred silkily. “I think it’s *adorable*…” and her lower lip pouted in feigned sympathy. You rolled your eyes at how much of shit she was being.

“Oh yeah?” you huffed playfully in return, “Well I think you can go fuck yourself,” you pouted back.

She said nothing, of course—just raised that fucking eyebrow at you before biting a hot kiss against the flesh of your abdomen, and dragging a hand over the crotch of your trousers and down your inner thigh.

“Holy fucking shit,” you moaned again, eyes lolling back in your head for what felt like the hundredth time tonight.

You were sitting right on the edge of the chair back, and she crouched between your legs, which were casually splayed against the back of the arm chair.

Still looking directly at you, she began unlacing one of her heavy boots like she had all the time in the world. It was infuriating how deliberately slow she was being, and you watched her fingers work at the laces briefly, enjoying how tight her pants looked over her well-toned quads. She swapped to kneel on the other knee to untie her other shoe. She moved on to untie your own boots, slowly pulling the laces through the eyelets and loosening the tongue of each shoe, and you lifted each heel in turn to allow her to pull them off. She placed them neatly together next to the coffee table beside the arm chair.

She stood up to her full height, eyes still locked on yours, as she sexily kicked each of her boots off to the side, an effortless grin on her face. She was a few feet away from you now, and her eyes moved up and down your body, appraising you with immense satisfaction as she discarded her puffer vest from her broad shoulders.

“Damn, you’re so fucking gorgeous,” she huffed at you, her eyelids heavy with want again. Her right hand moved to her neck, and rubbed firmly at the muscles there, the flannel stretching over her bicep as she flexed. Her eyes were on you hotly, as if she was thinking of what she wanted to do with you next.

“I honestly can’t wait to taste you,” she breathed out lowly, her eyes burning with desire, chest rising and falling more obviously now.

“I’m very much looking forward to that.” You blinked slowly, imagining how her face would look between your thighs.

*Fuck*, you thought, *this was going to be a memorable evening.*

And that was really rather excellent, because the last time you’d hooked up with someone, it had been so very ordinary; aggressively fine; juuuuust ok. You’d been attracted to them, but that wasn’t the problem. The chemistry just… wasn’t really there. It was fun, and there was desire, but everything felt a bit perfunctory, and not especially memorable.

Abby, on the other hand—well, you were still fully clothed and you were somehow so worked up from the way she was teasing you that you knew it would take only a modicum of effort on her part to tip you over the edge.

You leaned forward, desperately wanting to feel her naked body against yours as soon as humanly possible. Your fingers grabbed the belt loops of her navy trousers and pulled, and she allowed you to pull her heavy frame between your legs again. Now that she was the one standing, her much taller figure towered over you and she looked down lustfully at your features, and pulled closer so you were nestled warmly within her beefy arms. You hooked your thumbs inside the waistband of her trousers, hands resting on her hips.

“You have really beautiful eyes, you know,” she whispered, tucking an errant lock of hair that had fallen to your brow back in place.

You hadn’t been expecting this kind of affection in that moment. It was disarming as hell, and actually really fucking nice. You blushed, smiling, and she bit her lip in return.

You yanked her hips even closer to yours. She was flush against your crotch now, her warm hands moved to cup either side of your face. She dropped her head to kiss you, braid falling over one shoulder, and her tongue moved to softly intertwine with yours.

As she kissed you deeply, you had the awareness to notice how good she tasted: smoky, from the whiskey, and an earthy pine scent that you could detect from somewhere below her shirt collar. You breathed in deeply, taking in her heady scent and letting out a satisfied hum against her mouth. You felt her smile sweetly against your lips, and it caused your breath to catch in your throat.

Fuck.

She was so sexy, that much was indisputable; but she was being so casually intimate with you, like you’d both been here before. How could she be sexy and new and familiar and sweet all at once? What the hell was going on? Could there be more here than a one night stand..?

*Don’t get carried away*, you thought, *you hardly know her*. This was just simple, meaningless, no-strings sex.

…That was confusingly, loin-quiveringly hot and intimate.

***Shhh! Quiet brain, just sex, okay? Sexy hot sex with a mysterious sexy lumberjack woman***.

You blinked your eyes to shake the thoughts swirling around your head, and resolved to simply enjoy yourself and have a good time getting fucked by this Adonis.

You lifted your head a little so you could kiss at the spot just inside her shirt collar, and were hit again by that woody pine fragrance that smelled so good. You danced your lips, feather-light, over her collarbone and across to the small divot at the base of her throat, leaving a trail of soft, wet kisses as you went. She sighed so breathily at this that it surprised you.

“Mmmh… you feel so perfect kissing me,” she whispered, so quietly, and as she closed her eyes and let her head fall back slightly, a soft, barely perceptible, drawn-out *hmmmm* escaped her lips.

You breathed hotly against her skin at the sound, and then dusted further gentle kisses against her throat and chest, following the crease between her pecs as your hands moved to the top button of her heavy plaid shirt.

“Is this ok?” you asked, pulling on the button while looking inquisitively at her.

“Yeah,” she nodded, tongue pressing against the roof of her mouth as another of those unknowable looks played across her eyes.

You began unfastening her shirt, fingertips trailing gradually down, revealing a loose-ish white cotton t-shirt underneath. Her fingers threaded through your hair messily, and when you reached the final button, you wrested the remainder of the fabric from the waistband of her trousers. Her arms and shoulders flexed and tensed against the white cotton beneath as she manoeuvred the fabric off her torso and tossed it to the ground.

You could see the defined shape of the muscles under her shirt sleeves, and the subtle rise of fabric at her chest belied her small breasts. The hard peaks of her nipples, on the other hand, were not as subtle. You bit your lip, and looked up at her, your arousal apparent. She looked down at her chest, shrugged, and made a face at you that you took to mean something like, “Oh, you’re into this? Cool.” Her confidence made you chuckle, and at that, you tugged the front of her tee to pull her in to you to make out again.

She obliged, kissing you eagerly. Her hands moved to either side of your face again, then traveled slowly down over the front of your shoulders, down past your chest—brushing one of your nipples along the way, you noted—and then over your abdomen to the hem of your t-shirt and sweater. Her fingers curled under the layers of fabric, and she began pulling them upward.

She looked at you, eyes soft, eyebrows raised inquisitively, and her full lips curled at the corners.

“Okay if I get rid of these…?” she asked, fingernails dragging enticingly at the skin beneath your shirt and sweater.

“Yeah, yes, mmhmm—all clothes optional, at this point,” you assured her, pulling your lower lip between your teeth, anticipation swelling inside your chest. She manoeuvred your shirt and sweater slowly upwards while she kissed you, making sure to not-so-subtly brush the hem of the fabric over your nipples. She discarded the clothes on the seat of the arm chair you behind you, and her hands moved back to your waist and she took in the shape of you through heavy-lidded eyes, which were now looking ravenously at you.

One of her hands moved to your chest, casually teasing your nipple with her thumb. Your torso felt significantly more sensitive now it was bare, and your eyelids fluttered as she pulled a nipple roughly between her thumb and forefinger.

Abby bit her lip hungrily. She moved one hand to the small of your back, fingers splayed to support you so she could push your shoulders back before descending on your nipple with her mouth. Her free hand worked the surrounding flesh, as she sucked the sensitive nub between her pillowy-soft lips before scraping it ever so lightly with her teeth.

“Oh fuckkk,” you moaned, back arching toward her mouth, doing your best to brace yourself with your arms against the wide, flat backrest of the arm chair. The sensations she was effecting on your body had you seeing stars.

She angled her head to look at your face, and meeting your eyes, she returned her mouth to lick and suck again at your nipples again. Her tongue was hot as hell, and her eyes were so, so dark. Your eyelids fluttered, overwhelmed by the pleasure of her mouth on your body. She was still watching you intently when her teeth pulled—*much* more sharply this time—at your nipple.

“Ohmygod,” you blurted out helplessly, as she soothed the skin with her pillowy lips before moving to administer the same blissful pain to your other nipple. Each flick of her tongue and scrape of her teeth—along with the indulgent sight of watching her mouth explore you—was causing your clit to twitch pleasurably, and you were aching to feel her fingers and mouth on your cunt.

“Fuck, Abby—I need—” you started, looking desperately into her eyes, and she raised her eyes to meet yours, placing wet kisses on your skin.

“What is it, baby? What do you need?” her low voice almost a growl, asking the question she already knew the answer to, her eyes burning with lust for you. You saw her lick her lips, her breath heavy in anticipation as her free hand moved down to rub small, slow circles against your hip. She was waiting for you to say it; to beg.

“I need—” you panted out breathlessly. She merely raised her eyebrows expectantly at you, still waiting for your answer. “Abby—*please,* fuck me. I need to feel you inside me,” you implored.

Satisfied with your answer, her upper lip curled into an almost-snarl, tongue pressing into the sharp point of her incisor. She pulled you towards her so your butt was perched right on the edge of the chair back.

She kissed you so thoroughly, so passionately, her tongue moving hotly against yours and sending waves of pleasure pulsing through your body.

Her hand moved from your hip to the apex of your thighs, her fingers trailing down to the seam of your trousers so her fingertips could circle your clitoris through the fabric there. You felt the walls of your cunt clench eagerly in response, and a loud moan escaped your lips.

Both hands now moved to unfasten your trousers, and then she hooked her fingers over the waistband and you lifted your ass up a bit so she could wriggle them off your hips, leaving your underwear in place. Crouching again, she pulled your pants carefully down your legs, extricating you of them along with your socks.

When she had cast them aside, she returned to stand between your legs, spreading them further apart while her hands rubbed with careful pressure against your inner thighs. One hand inched upwards very gradually, until she could brush softly back and forth against the very visible dampness on your underwear. Her mouth fell open with want as she felt how hot and wet you were for her.

Her hand moved further up and she began to circle your clitoris through the fabric with her fingers. Watching as her capable hands worked you into a frenzied state made your abdomen and thighs tense, pleasure coiling below your stomach in response. She was alternating between applying firm pressure at your clit and dipping the tip of her index finger down to tease against the line where your underwear met your skin, sliding further and further under the fabric with each subsequent encounter.

After a few torturous minutes of this, during which she intermittently dropped her head down to press wet kisses to your mouth, you were falling apart. Your body was practically vibrating with the need to feel her—*hands? tongue?* you didn’t really care at this point—directly against your flesh. You moaned her name, and she pouted her soft lips on hearing how desperate you were for her.

She knelt between your legs again, her mouth replacing her hands to press hot, hungry kisses against the damp of your underwear, and you saw her inhale the heady scent of you there.

“You know, I really *am* looking forward to fucking you with my tongue…” she drawled out, her eyes narrow with her own desire, as she kissed lazily against the last remaining fabric covering your flesh. “…but I think I wanna feel how wet you are for me with my fingers, first,” she mused.

And with that, she peeled your underwear slowly down with both hands before kneeling between your legs, a beefy arm draped across one of your thighs, a hand softly stroking against your hip. The other hand, meanwhile, was snaking up your leg towards your throbbing cunt that was replete with arousal for her. She splayed her palm against the patch of hair just above your labia, and allowed her thumb to brush over your soft lips while she dotted your inner thighs with gentle kisses. Your lips were parted, anticipation building.

And then the tips of her fingers dragged softly through your wet folds.

“Ohhhhh fuck, baby… you feel so good. You’re so wet for me,” she whispered.

You moaned loudly at her words, your hips jerking as she continued sliding her fingers painfully slowly through your slick, careful to deliberately skim past the aching bundle of nerves where you most craved her touch. She was panting, visibly elated by your pained reaction, as she watched you fall apart, the dedication to your eventual satiety writ large across her face.

You thought you might explode at the sight of how turned on she was by you. She dragged her fingertips through your slick once more, before she pulled them away and brought glistening fingers up to your mouth, a sultry look in her eyes.

And when your tongue went to lick and suck the taste of you from her fingers, a loud moan erupted from within her, and her usually-composed body shuddered uncontrollably with want.

Her hand moved to the back of your neck to pull your lips towards hers, and she kissed you greedily, her mouth hot with need for you, tongue entwined with yours, so she could taste you for herself. She was so turned on that she was panting, breath ragged.

“You taste so fucking incredible. I could eat you out for days,” she said, fingers rubbing at the skin against the back of your neck. She bit her lip, a dazed look across her features.

“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” you dared her in a whisper, cocking your head to one side, while your hand moved to bury your fingers in the back of her braid at the base of her scalp, jerking her head back slightly with your hand. Her mouth fell open, taken aback by this small act of dominance, before morphing into a wicked sneer that spread wide across her face. She was breathing heavily, completely consumed by what she wanted to do to you in return for this minor transgression.

“Don’t worry,” she replied, and her tone was suitably aloof, eyebrow arched confidently—”I never do.”

Her hand had already returned to touch you, and she was sliding a single finger down the length of your slit, and then teasing where your slick pooled at your entrance. “Are you ready for me to make you come so hard that you’ll have to beg me to stop?”

*Fuck yes*, you thought.

But you brain was too clouded to formulate a coherent response by that point, because she was blowing your mind with the indecency of her words, and her ravenous mouth, and her dextrous hands; and so—you just nodded with urgent sincerity, imploring her to take you apart.

She watched you through half-lidded eyes, an unmistakeable look of arousal on her face, as she slid a thick finger easily inside you.

You saw stars at the pleasurable intrusion, unable to focus on anything other than the sensation of her slowly pulling her finger out of you, and then inching teasingly back in.

Her eyes rolled back in ecstasy as she felt how tight you were around her fingers, and you could see her losing composure in response.

“Fuckkk, baby,” she murmured, eyes almost closed, voice low and dripping with desire. “Are you always this wet?”

“No,” you replied, shaking your head, eyes earnest and a blush staining your cheeks as her eyes fixed onto yours.

“Fuck. Really…?” she responded seriously, raising her eyebrows in genuine surprise that very quickly turned into a thoroughly satisfied smirk.

She entered you with a second, thick finger, increasing her pace, and curling her fingers upwards to nudge insistently at your g-spot with each thrust. You groaned at the pleasurable fullness of her, as she thrust her fingers in and out of your cunt with greater urgency.

“Oh jesus, fuck. Abby, you feel so fucking good inside me,” you exhaled, eyes rolling back in your head. She was loving the way you were responding to her hands.

With her other hand, she dipped her thumb into the arousal that was pooled at your opening, and moved to press the flat of her hand against the base of your abdomen to steady her hand so she could rub firmer circles against your sensitive clit. The pace of her thrusts was increasing, and her fingers pushing further into your depths.

You were coming properly undone now. *How the hell did she feel this good?* you thought. It was as if she knew your body, knew what you wanted, how hard you wanted to be fucked, how much to tease you, what pressure you needed where.

And how the hell did she look *this* good doing it? Her eyes were dark with desire, pupils blown wide and mouth open, breaths heavy, quiet groans and grunts falling from her throat as she fucked you into oblivion. The sight of the muscles in her arms and shoulders flexing and tensing as she entered you over and over was so gratifying to watch, and added another layer of headiness to the sensations she was eliciting within you.

She bit her lip roughly as she watched your cunt squeeze against her fingers as they disappeared into the heat of you, your hips grinding down to meet her rhythm as she fucked you. Your moans were growing louder and louder, and she urged your pleasure onward with the firm pressure of her thumb on your clit, intensity building each time her thick fingers railed into you, her pace escalating.

“You look so good getting fucked by me,” she panted, and she, too, was barely holding it together now. Her thumb continued circling faster and harder against your clit, while the pace of her fingers thrusting into you was frantic now, the palm of her hand slapping wetly against you as she fucked you deeper. The pulsing pressure of her fingertips against your inner wall was pushing you closer toward your release, your cunt tensing around her, as you felt a fire within your core consuming you.

You were an absolute mess in her hands, and your slick was all over her hands.

“Abby, I’m so close—jesus. Fuck.” Your eyes were scrunched up in ecstasy, and your moans were guttural now.

“Harder?” she offered, voice hot, barely a whisper, and her eyes were so sex-drunk that they were barely wider than slits.

“Yeah—yes—” you nodded, and then her fingers were pounding into your pussy, while she working furiously at your clit with her other hand. Her moans were matching yours as she fucked you, and they only dialled up your arousal to another level. The muscles in your own arms were burning from supporting your bodyweight for so long, but you know it wouldn’t be much longer before you reached the peak of your pleasure.

“Ughh… Abby, I’m—gonna come—please, don’t stop,” you begged, breath ragged, the pressure mounting insistently.

“I promise I won’t, baby,” she replied, and there was so much lust there, but also tenderness. “It’s ok, baby, let go, let me wreck you with my hands,” she purred, urging you on, and the strength of her fingers slamming against your g-spot and the fevered circles on your clit were tipping you over the edge, pressure coiling tighter and higher within you.

“Come for me, baby,” she whispered, just a breath, eyes fixed intently on yours, coaxing your orgasm over the precipice; and fuck, it was all just so much, and she felt *so good*—

And your orgasm washed over you, seismic waves of your pleasure shuddering through your whole body as you shook intensely, hips riding down uncontrollably onto Abby’s strong hand. You could feel your muscles clenching tightly around her as she continued fucking you through it all, and her eyes remained fixed on yours the entire time, indulging the effect she was having on your body.

The waves of your climax gradually subsided, and you were both breathing heavily. She was looking up at you, eyes burning into yours, and your eyelids fluttered, arms feeling weak. She eased her fingers out of you, your cunt lurching deliciously as she did so. She dragged one of her fingers up and across the tip of her tongue to taste you, eyelashes fluttering as she did so, and you felt your body shiver at the sight. She moaned breathily, taking in the view of your spent body.

She splayed her broad hand over your abdomen, gently rubbing against the skin there.

“Fuck, baby. It was so hot watching you come.” She was dusting hot, wet kisses across your thighs. You could see from the redness at her cheeks that she’d loved every minute of watching your tension break under her hands. You could only hum in pleasure at her words, though—you were struggling to keep your eyes open from the intensity of your orgasm.

She stood, and pulled you toward her with both arms, and held your head against her chest, fingers in your hair, while you breathing gradually slowed. You were thankful to take the pressure off your arms, falling into the strength and warmth of her body, hands under her shirt, wanting to feel as much of her as possible against your skin. She bent down to kiss you, tongue lingering against yours. You could taste your arousal on tongue, and it was sexy as hell.

You were craving to watch her fall apart, to discover how she liked to be touched, how to bring her to the brink, what would tip her over the edge—but your head was swimming and your body was all floppy from the intensity of your orgasm. You were exhausted, and desperate to fall asleep cocooned in her arms. You let one of your move to rest against her tight abdomen, as she kissed your mouth with an unexpected tenderness, and ran her fingers softly through your hair.

Goosebumps prickled your skin now as the heat of your orgasm subsided, and you shivered against her large frame. She noticed, and rubbed her hands over your arms to warm you.

“Awww, you sweet thing,” she said, chuckling in adoration at your post-orgasmic chill. “Let’s get you warm ok?”

You nodded, and she moved away briefly to grab one of the blankets draped over the sofa. She wrapped it around your shoulders, and then placed your arms around her neck, before scooping you up against her well-muscled frame.

She carried you with ease upstairs to her bedroom, your brain blissed out and foggy, and she lowered you carefully on the bed. You were vaguely aware of the sound of her unfastening her trousers and letting them fall to the floor, and then she climbed into the bed beside you, and pulled the covers up to cocoon you both.

She was on her side, facing you, and she tucked one arm behind your head, tugging you towards the nook of her shoulder and chest with the other, and you wriggled closer, legs tangling into hers. Her mouth was resting comfortingly against your forehead, and she pressed a few soft kisses there as she pulled you snugly against her body.

Half asleep already, you remembered something that seemed important to share.

“Hey. Abby,” you began, voice heavy with sleep, and there was an deliberately sulky, petulant tone in your words. “You still haven’t fucked me with your mouth yet, you know. Don’t think I didn’t notice, ok?” you breathed out, and you felt her chest judder a few times, presumably chuckling at you holding her accountable. “It’s ok, though,” you reassured her in a daze, “you can make it up to me in the morning.”

You felt her release a hot breath against your forehead, as her mouth curl into a smile against you. You fell asleep to the earthy scent of pine trees, and the feeling of her fingers stroking softly against your back.

## Axe To Grind

<aside>
<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>“You’re so fucking sexy that it might destroy me,” she whispered, and there was not a sound in the room apart from her aching voice and your heavy breaths. She was intoxicated by you, and you could see that her composure was beginning to break.
“Then let me destroy you; I wanna taste you,” you offered in reply.
--
You wake up in a bed that isn't yours, being spooned by a tanky lumberjack. One thing definitely leads to another, and that 'another' is you making Abby come.
As you get to know Abby a little better, this definitely isn't feeling like any one night stand you've had before.
But that's too good to be true, right? She wouldn't want anything more, would she? And if she did—would you even be ready for that?</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>So this chapter was meant to be wayyyyy shorter, but when I started writing the smut... it just got really long. I was having such fun writing it, and didn't want to rush through the first time we see Abby getting railed. So: hope y'all delight in this even more ridiculously indulgent smut and fluff.
I'm having a lot of fun working my way through this story. They are really enjoyable characters to write.
Thanks for all your comments, they really motivate me to keep writing!

</aside>

Your mouth stretched into a leisurely yawn, and you pulled the covers up around your neck, rubbing your feet together. Fighting off the pink glow of the sunlight through your eyelids, you squeezed your eyelids together more tightly, but your brain had already been coaxed out of its slumber.

Your nose became aware of something. A different smell. It was like the smell of the forest when you went hiking. Hmm. That was weird. Maybe you left a window open? But why would you have had the window open so late in the year?

*Wait.*

Your eyelids peeked open, a little disoriented as your brain slowly came back into focus.

*Oh.*

Wait. This wasn’t your bed.

*OH.*

And you weren’t alone.

*Ohhhhh.*

You felt a warm body press against your back, as a hand ventured past your waist and shifted to land upon your stomach, fingers playing back and forth over the skin. A small smile curled on your lips as you blinked your eyes open properly now. Your hand drifted down to Abby’s, and you interlaced your fingers with hers.

“Mmmmm… morning,” Abby’s sleepy, husky voice breathed out, soft lips pressing against your back.

“Good morning,” you yawned, pointing your toes into a stretch and feeling a dull ache of your calves.

“Did you sleep ok?”

You yawned. “Mmmm, yeah, like the dead.” Your eyes were still heavy.

“I’m glad to hear.” She pulled herself closer against your back, dusting small kisses to your neck and shoulders, while the hand against your abdomen drew your fingers against hers a little tighter. You could feel the soft fabric of her t-shirt against your skin. You reached a hand back to give her tight butt and thighs a squeeze, which she seemed to enjoy, and it seemed she was wearing cotton boxers now.

You took in what you could see of the room. There was a massive floor-to-ceiling window on part of the opposite wall, and you could see the tops of pine trees that looked wet from the storm overnight. It was cloudy and grey, but a bit of sun shone through the clouds, and in the morning light, you could see the summit of a mountain shrouded by clouds a little way off.

There was a door on the wall just past the nightstand, and a long, low mid-century modern sideboard made of oak sat against the far wall, laden with various accoutrements: a crooked pile of what looked like books about finance and economics with a laptop and a pair of prescription glasses tenuously perched atop them; a vintage record player in the middle that led to a pair of large, old-fashioned speakers on either side of the cabinet; a gleaming gold cocktail tray with handles, upon which sat a few decanters of brown liquid and a pair of upturned crystal tumblers that matched ones she’d served drinks in last night; and a fancy-looking candle in a glass jar with a wooden lid. At the end of the sideboard was a few small, carved wooden animals of different sizes: a deer, an owl, and a bear.

Opposite the foot of the bed against the wall, there was a matching oak dresser with a pile of neatly folded wool sweaters and business shirts, and a small tray bearing a few bottles of cologne and a couple of pairs of cufflinks.

Everything in the room was neatly organised, just like the living space downstairs had been. The only thing out of place was a low, wooden tray that had been haphazardly placed atop the corner of the dresser, and upon which lay a ratty old towel, a well-used leather tool roll loaded with with various work-working tools—chisels, a rasp and a file; you recognised these from your own work with woodblock printing—and next to that, a few half-carved chunks of wood, surrounded by wood shavings and other bits of debris. *A fellow woodworker? What are the odds…*

You were distracted by Abby nuzzling into the crook of your neck and shoulder, and nibbling at your earlobe softly.

“Hmmmmm,” you groaned luxuriously at the feeling of her body on yours, pushing your butt against her pelvis as you pulled both your interwoven hands up against your chest cozily. You smiled sweetly, eyes closing with contentment. “Do you know what time it is?”

She was still rousing, too, voice a little husky from sleep. “Uhhhh… just a sec,” she planted a kiss on your cheek, and rolled away to reach over to the nightstand by the other side of the bed. “It’s like… 7:20-ish?” She rolled back toward you, sneaking one arm beneath your neck and the other back around your waist, wrapping you up warmly. One of her feet snuck between your own, and she rubbed it against yours. It felt comforting and natural, these little gestures of hers.

“Mmmm,” you sighed sleepily, sliding your feet together with Abby’s, and then letting out an unexpectedly massive yawn. “Ugh! It’s too earlyyyyy,” you whined sulkily, in a pout. You were not a morning person.

Abby snorted out a quiet-but-derisive chuckle. “Pfft, I’ve normally done a whole weights session and had breakfast by this time,” and she scattered a few small kisses over your neck and shoulders.

“Oh really?” you said, suggestively waggling your eyebrows, and wriggling your shoulders further back into the warm cocoon of her body, so that she would wrap you up in her arms more tightly.

“Mmm-hmm,” she murmured, pleased, before letting out a soft yawn herself. “Slept right through, today, though—” more kisses against your neck; lips lingered a little longer on your skin, “I guess you must have tuckered me out a bit last night.” She propped an elbow up and rested her head against it, fingertips brushing gently up and down one side of your body.

She was looking down at you, a relaxed, contented look on her face, but her eyes were narrow and taking in the parts of you that weren’t hidden under the blanket. You rolled yourself back and towards her torso, looking over your shoulder at her, and her hand moved further up to your chest and smoothed your skin with her fingers.

You both lay there for a moment, half-awake, staring into one another’s sleepy eyes.

*This is so weirdly easy*, you thought. *What’s the catch here?*

A beefy, dreamy lumberjack who has her own luxe cabin in the wilderness, spends all night fucking you into a state of euphoria, spoons you while you both fall asleep, and then wakes you up in the warmest, snuggliest, hugs and showers you with sweet affection? No other one night thing had ever resulted in… whatever was going on right now. It was sort of surreal, and very, *very* unexpected—but also, you admitted, it was completely lovely.

Abby must have noticed the curious look on your face.

“What..? What’s up?” Her brows were knitted together quizzically.

“It’s nothing, it’s just—” you paused, and she tilted her head toward you and raised her eyebrows expectantly, waiting for you to finish your sentence. You chuckled. “Well—it’s just… this is a… a really weird one night stand?” your words, both statement and question, caused you to laugh a bit awkwardly, and she looked immediately huffy and offended, but in a playful way.

“Oof, I’m *terribly* sorry,” she mocked, hands backing away from your body in feigned protest. “I’ll just leave you, then, shall I—?” and she went to move to the other side of the bed.

“Nononono, shut up,” you back-pedalled hurriedly and smirked, grabbing her wrists roughly to pull them back to your waist while rolling your eyes. “I didn’t mean it like *that*.” Her face was still sardonically huffy, a cute little pout on her lips; but she allowed her hands to be pressed against your body and wrapped you up tightly in her arms again, grinning.

“Hmm, see, can’t resist me, can you? Not even for a second,” her eyebrow cocked and she dusted a few soft kisses on either side of your face.

You laughed at her easy confidence, before continuing your original point. “I mean, that’s definitely accurate—” a smirk, ”but, like, you have to admit: this *is* unusual.” She watched, listening, and you went on, “I mean, I’m not sure what it’s been like for you, and well, my hook-ups are usually fine, buuuuuut… you know. Only *very, aggressively* fine. And, well… last night was—” you blushed, remembering her fingers inside you, fucking you, while she kissed you breathless. “—it was…”

She cut you off, kissing against your neck, eyes hooded once more, “Mind-blowing, hot as hell, best sex of your life…?” she rattled off a list of options for you, a far-away look in her eyes and smugness exuding from every line of her face.

You playfully slapped the back of your hand against her collarbone, but she just grinned, clearly pleased with herself and how good she *knew* she’d made you feel. You rolled your eyes again, eyelids fluttering. “Are you *always* this much of a pain in the ass the morning after?”

“I dunno, am I? Maybe you’ll have to hang around and find out.” She flashed her ‘stop talking and let me do dirty things to you’ sex-eyes in your direction, as one of those big, strong hands moved to cup your ass cheek and give it a satisfying squeeze that sent a thrill up your spine. You let out a soft pant, and she moaned lowly under her breath in reply. You could feel the flush on your face creeping up quickly as she kissed you, tongue finding yours immediately, teeth nipping at your lower lip.

*Fuck.* How was she able to make you *so* aroused\*,\* *so* quickly? You could feel the wetness pooling between your thighs already.

She pulled your body against hers, and you could feel her nipples hard against your skin from beneath her t-shirt. One hand was edging up the inside of your thigh, while she was comprehensively devouring you with her kisses.

Her hand reached your apex, and she brushed your labia delicately with her fingertips. “Is this ok?” she asked, voice sultry as hell. Your core was already aching to feel her inside you again.

“Oh, *fuck*, Abby… yeah…” you gasped, your breathing already laboured with desire. Your head pulled back, eyes sincere—albeit, a little pathetic with need for her. “How on earth are you just constantly this sexy?” you demanded.

“Well, I *did* tell you I like an early start in the morning…” She smirked against the skin of your neck as she said it, before biting your skin roughly. You could feel the rakish grin on her mouth as she sucked and kissed and grazed her teeth over you. And then, her fingers were drifting past your clitoris, sliding eagerly down to your entrance.

“Jesus, *fuck*,” her eyes pressed shut with an almost-pained look on her face when she felt how soaked you were. “I swear to fucking god… How on earth do you get *this* wet this quickly?” and she dragged her fingers through your folds. “It’s like—I can’t—I—” she faltered, staring right at you and lost for words, mouth open, brows furrowed in a mixture of absolute disbelief and thirst. She was practically panting.

One hand on your back, she pushed you onto your back so she was on top of you, straddling your waist, slick fingers now rubbing insistently at your sensitive clit. Her hand moved to the back of your neck to pull your mouth up to hers and you hungrily consumed everything piece of her she was willing to give.

Your hands fumbled against her shirt. “This—off. Now,” you demanded, yanking the fabric up higher. She blinked at you slowly, eyes heavily lidded, and pushed herself up so she was kneeling above you and sitting upright. You could feel the heat simmering beneath her boxers against the flesh of your stomach.

Hands moving to her shirt, she made a deliberate show of flexing her arms as she pulled it off by taking it unnecessarily high over her head, before tossing it lazily to the floor. A hand went to sexily rub that spot at the back of her neck, showing off the thickness of her shoulders, arms, and well-defined lats. You revelled in the small tuft of blonde hair at each armpit that somehow just added to the heady allure of everything about her.

But her muscles, though. *Holy shit,* you thought, *the home gym downstairs sure is paying off.* Your mouth hung open slackly and your eyes went wide at the divine landscape of her torso that had revealed itself before you.

The abdominal muscles you’d felt with your hands last night? Yeah, they were basically chiselled into her abdomen. She had a sharp v-line that travelled from either hip, disappearing into her low-slung boxers, and there was a well-defined line that framed her pecs as well. Her breasts were small, her nipples erect, and you had to blink your eyes so that you were sure what you were seeing was real: sexy, tanky, goofy, charming, wood-cutting, crystal-glasses-with-a-matching-decanter, sweaters-folded-neatly-on-the-nightstand, and everything-tidily-in-its-place in her log cabin in the forest Abby… had pierced nipples.

You must have been staring a little too obviously—although, you honestly didn’t care at this point—because she let out a delighted huff of air. “Oh, you like these?” she looked casually from your eyes, to her nipples, and then cocked her head to one side and gyrated her hips ever so slightly against yours as she did so. She moved her fingers to one of her hard nipples, and tugged lightly, catching the end of the thick, silver barbell between her finger and thumb before letting go. “They feel fucking incredible when bitten, too,” she added suggestively.

A bolt of pleasure shot immediately to your cunt. You were salivating.

“Oh my fucking… *fuck*. Abby.” You self-control snapped, and you pushed yourself forward with your arms so you were sitting upright against her body, and launched yourself mouth-first onto Abby’s sculpted stomach.

Even though her body was so toned, you relished in the fact that she was still quite broad at her waist. You kissed at the fleshy spot above her hips, hungrily biting down and eliciting soft pants from Abby’s perfect fucking mouth.

Your fingernails scraped from her pecs to her abdomen before you returned to pull at her nipple with your fingers, rubbing and pinching at the sensitive nub

“Ugh… fuck,” Abby moaned loudly, head dropping back in pleasure. She buried the fingers of one hand in the back of your hair, and you looked up at her as her gorgeous, muscular body towering over you, as your lust-filled eyes fixed keenly on hers.

From your view below her, you could see Abby’s chest heaving, and her mouth agape.

“My turn to take *you* apart,” you purred, as you dashed the flat of your tongue against the hard lines of her abs before scraping your teeth against her skin. She let out another eager moan.

You continued working your mouth at the taut flesh of her stomach while your fingers toyed at her nipples, rubbing and flicking alternately. You locked eyes with her again, hands grasping either side of her ribs as you dragged your tongue slowly from the flat of her stomach to her left nipple, leaving a glistening trail of saliva in its wake.

She was watching you intently, eyes burning into yours, as your tongue flicked over the nub teasingly, before you blew delicate puffs of breath against the wet peak. Abby’s eyes fluttered, and she bit her lip, jaw tensing and teeth gritted, as you blinked your eyes slowly, sweetly, nefariously, at her.

“You are so fucking gorgeous,” she licked her lips, her free hand moving to your face so her thumb could stroke against your jawline as you teased her. You moved back a little from her chest, and your own mouth was open, soft little pants escaping in hot breaths. “The things I wanna do to you…” she continued.

Her thumb moved from your jawline to brush slowly along your lower lip, pulling it down just a little with the pad of her thumb. Her pupils were dark and huge, brows furrowed seriously. All your senses were focused, eyes fixed on hers for a moment, as you opened your mouth a little wider to nudge the flat of your tongue carefully against the flesh of her thumb, and you felt it brush softly against your lower lip before you pulled back. You could see her jaw slackening further still, her need for you growing more urgent, as she returned her thumb to your mouth to drag it down the length of your tongue all over again, a millimetre at a time.

“You’re so fucking sexy that it might destroy me,” she whispered, and there was not a sound in the room apart from her aching voice and your heavy breaths. She was intoxicated by you, and you could see that her composure was beginning to break.

“Then *let* me destroy you; I wanna taste you,” you offered in reply.

She paused, eyes on you, as if trying to decide whether or not to fully relinquish control. But then she let out a small, barely perceptible nod.

Your eyes flashed darkly in response. You surged towards her chest, descending on one of her nipples, tongue laving at the sensitive nub and pulling back against the barbell with your teeth.

“*Hnghhh…*” Abby let out a heavenly, drawn-out little whine in response that caused all the moisture in your body to head south. You worked the surrounding flesh with your hand as you devoured her nipple, before pulling your mouth away with a wet pop and licking your way across her pecs to give the other nipple equal attention. Abby’s fingers tangled roughly in your hair and she allowed her head to fall back, her moans and pants coming much more frequently in response to the mixture of pleasure and pain you were inflicting upon her body.

Meanwhile, you allowed your free hand to drift gradually downwards to her boxers, passing over the subtle mound at the base of her pelvis. You crept your fingertip along the crease her labia made against the fabric, and gasped: her boxers were soaked through with her arousal. Your eyes met, but she said nothing; she just looked at you lustfully, panting, her need evident.

You were so aroused that it felt as if you were glowing with heat. You were desperate to feel more of her, but the lower half of you was still pinned beneath Abby’s herculean thighs. Leaning closer to her, you pushed assertively against her rock-hard abs with your palms. “If you want me to do this properly,” you said, “you need to give me some room to work.” She looked at you inquisitively and then lifted herself up and off you and lay casually facing you on top of the sheets.

“Edge of the bed,” you commanded softly, voice barely above a whisper. You gathered it wasn’t often that people told Abby what to do—at least not in the the bedroom—but, here you were, and so it was.

And again, she said nothing; just smirked, raised her eyebrows at you, and then did as she was told, compliantly pivoting around so her butt was on the edge of the mattress, legs wide, and she leaned back with arms outstretched behind her in a way that caused the veins of her forearms to pop a little.

With her body faced away from you, you took a moment to bask in the view: the muscles of her back were well-defined and taut, and the thickness of her shoulders made your mouth water. Her freckled skin was studded with light beads of sweat, braid hanging slightly to one side between her shoulder blades. She turned her head to her left to look at you over her shoulder, jaw set and looking oh-so-fine, those dark blonde eyelashes lowered and lips parted in anticipation of your next move. She looked statuesque like this, as if perfectly chiseled from stone for your enjoyment.

Grabbing one of the pillows, you moved from the bed and walked slowly over to stand in front of her, those unfathomably-blue eyes following your every move. You dropped the pillow in front of her, and kneeling between her thighs, wasted no time at all hooking your fingers over the waistband of her boxers, your eyes darting hungrily to the damp patch of fabric, and then back to her face.

Her mouth hitched into a smug little smile, that one eyebrow arched, and when she spoke, her voice was barely above a murmur: “Like I said, you’re gonna destroy me,” and you smiled at hearing such a sweet concession of power from those perfect, pillowy lips.

She lifted her hips off the bed with her hands as you pulled down the boxers inch by inch, her knees moving together briefly so that you could peel them off and cast them aside; and then she settled on the bed as before, arms behind her and legs spread confidently wide before you. Her tongue played against her teeth as she savoured the sight of you taking in the view before you.

Your eyes were transfixed: soft blonde hair framed the pink flesh of her cunt, her folds absolutely glistening with her arousal. Her lips jutted out puffily, and her prominent clit was engorged, peeking out from underneath its hood.

“*Fuck,* you look so good, Abby,” you uttered, taking in every single inch of her sex with your eyes. You licked your lips, barely able to process the reality that you were about to devour her, and your own sex was thoroughly drenched at the thought.

You moved forward between her legs, a hand on either thigh, and she watched as you leaned upwards on your hands to land a few searing kisses against her nipples, mouth licking and kissing from there down to her torso and through the soft blonde patch of hair at her pelvis. Quiet moans were pouring intermittently from her lips as you moved lower, kissing and licking along her labia, being careful to avoid any sensation against her most sensitive parts so as to keep her hanging on a little longer.

Her cunt clenched visibly with need. “Uhhh… *fuck*…” she moaned, louder now, and seeing how altogether desperate she was for you to touch her was driving you wild.

When you moved your hand closer, teasing her folds lightly with just your thumb, she absolutely lost it.

“Oh *fuck*… oh my… fucking *god,*” she whined desperately, one hand moving to entwine her fingers with your free hand, squeezing a little too hard when you brushed along the length of her folds with the pad of your thumb.

She was jutting her hips up towards your mouth, and leaning back further, aching for you as her head fell back revealing the pale skin of her throat. She still looked exquisitely powerful somehow, even as she crumbled in response to your touch. She was so at ease displaying the strength of her body, her muscled legs splayed creating a sturdy foundation for the precise work of your hands and mouth; and she was equally as comfortable in allowing her composure to fall visibly before your eyes as she savoured every bit of the pleasure you apportioned her. Her confidence and self-assurance was breathtaking, and such a turn-on.

And when your soft mouth pressed a wet kiss to her clit, she bucked her hips towards you uncontrollably.

“Oh *fuck*, baby…,” she groaned uncontrollably, as your mouth inched closer to the place where she most craved you.

You dragged your tongue up through her folds to suck more earnestly on her sensitive nub, a moan escaping your own lips. “Abby, oh my fucking *god*, you taste incredible,” you murmured, as your fingers nudged at the wetness of her opening.

“Tell me what you like about it,” Abby implored you, a hand cupping your cheek.

“I love how wet you are for me, how soft you feel against my mouth,” you started, your words clearly arousing her further. “The way you taste—it’s musky and sweet and so good. I could eat you out all day.”

“Ugh. Fuck,” she panted out, voice low, “\*please—\*fuck me. I need to feel you; more of you,” and her body was shaking slightly, eyes closed and her breaths coming rapidly, and you saw that sweat gleamed on her chest now, too.

“Abby,” you panted, aroused and further emboldened by her words, “That would be my absolute fucking pleasure,” and you swiped your fingers down her wet folds a few times, teasing again at her entrance, before inching a single finger inside her. She was completely dripping now, and you slid inside her without any resistance as her body shuddered violently in response.

“Oh *fffff*—” she choked back her words, overwhelmed by just the tiniest sensation of you within her. Her hand returned to the back of your head again to tangle in your hair, and she pulled you back a little so she could look you in the eyes while you fucked her.

“Please—more,” she insisted, and she was so eager that you could feel her cunt twitch around your fingers. You nodded, edging a second finger inside her, and she was so indescribably wet that it made your head swim.

You lowered your mouth to feast on her clit with your mouth, and the pants coming from her were more frenzied now, her walls clenching around your fingers tightly as you began to thrust in and out again, taking your time so you could watch her fall apart.

“Another,” she demanded, through laboured breaths, her eyes almost black. You fixed your eyes on hers again, and she watched you intently as you circled her sensitive nub with your tongue and sucked it between your lips. The sensation caused her eyes to roll back.

“Ughh, your fucking *mouth*—” she sputtered, and right as she did so, you thrust three fingers into her, and began pumping more rapidly, curling the tips of them upward to search for the delicate bundle of nerves that you knew would wholly break her.

She let out an insistent groan. “*Ughhhhh*—yeah, that feels so good, keep going,” she urged, as you thrust your fingers in and out of her, your pace intensifying as you continued searching for the spot inside her. Your fingers were thoroughly coated in her arousal, your breathing erratic as you sucked on her clit; and when you found the spot inside her you were seeking—she completely lost any sense of composure.

She was groaning loudly, uncontrollably, her back arched, and she used her arms against the bed as leverage to bear down against your fingers to maximise her pleasure. “*Ohmyfuckinggod—*” she blurted in one desperate string of words, ”*please—harder—*” Her voice was *so* needy as she begged you to undo her, and you fucked her, fingertips pulsing frantically, insistently, against her g-spot as you entered her; your mouth sucking and tonguing at her swollen clit as her body trembled. You could feel her core throb around you, and her arousal ran down your palm to your wrist; and the soft, wet slapping noises your hand made as you thrust in and out of her were just *everything*. You were moaning along with her, and with all the euphoric sounds that were reverberating from deep within her chest.

“Baby, I’m so close. Don’t stop, *please*—” her voice was shaky, hips canting up towards you. Her hand tangled in your hair and tugged your head backwards slightly, so that your eyes would meet hers, her body shuddering. She panted, her eyebrows tense, and her mouth wide. Her entire body was rigid, the muscles of her abdomen framed in sharp lines as the pressure coiling tightly within her threatened to spill over.

Your eyes fixed on her, and as you sucked upon her clit lasciviously, you sank your fingers deeper inside her, thrusting intensely against that sensitive spot.

“Fuck, *fuck*, ohhh yesss, *ohhh*—!” Her orgasm erupted, body convulsing in ecstasy around you, and her pupils blown wide. A series of loud, low moans escaped her throat, abs taut and hips bucking against your hand and mouth as she was overcome by pleasure. Her body tensed and flexed powerfully as wave after wave of pleasure crashed over her.

You slowed the movements of your mouth and fingers gradually as her orgasm subsided. When her breathing slowed, you gave one last mischievous swipe of your tongue against her clit, watching her hips lurch a final time in response, as a broad, indulgent grin spread across her face.

“Oh *fuckkkk*…” she breathed out softly, allowing herself to fall back against the bed, thighs shaking and cunt twitching around you as you slowly removed your fingers. You were still between her legs on the floor, your knees smarting from bearing your weight for so long, and so you curled them beneath you comfortably. You dusted soft kisses against the hair at her pelvis, and folded your arms so you could rest your head atop her abdomen and enjoy the breathtaking view of her powerful body at ease, as her breaths began to steady.

After a minute or so, you crawled back onto the bed alongside her, kissing up her torso as you went. She lifted her feet to the edge of the mattress, and used them to push herself further back, making room for you to snuggle against her chest, one of her beefy arms wrapped lazily around you, the other folded comfortably behind her head.

You sighed, satisfied. “Well, that was—”

“—completely, totally, amazingly wonderful,” she offered, turning her head dopily towards yours so she could press a lazy kiss against your mouth. “Mmmm, fuck. You still taste like me,” she purred, smirking, clearly pleased by this.

You licked your lips, grinning back at her. “Honestly,” you responded, “You *taste* so fucking incredible, and you *look* so fucking incredible, and I just—I can’t—” you faltered, mind blown by how good she looked falling to pieces in front of you.

Her mouth curled into a relaxed, toothy smile. It was the first time you’d seen this kind of easy, warm expression on her face. She pulled you closer again to kiss you.

“So, I need to ask you a very important question,” she began, eyes seemingly serious all of a sudden, “Where the fuck did you learn to use those hands?” She grabbed your hand by the wrist, and brought it closer to her face as if she were inspecting it, turning it over, and pretending to look for fine details that might be concealed within.

You smirked, a little confused, “I mean, it’s not that hard is it…?”

“Hey!” she snapped back at you, pretending to take offence. You laughed, and she pulled your hand to her chest and wrapped it warmly with hers, fingers curling over yours, and her thumb stroking against the back of your hand.

“No, I just meant, I haven’t ever had a problem finding the g-spot, I guess,” you clarified, smiling.

“Fuck, well, I haven’t come that hard in a while, so… thanks for sharing your expertise with me,” she chuckled, pleased with her own joke.

You lay there for a few minutes, eyes closed peacefully and enjoying the warmth of her body against yours. When your eyes opened again, you were looking at her hand on yours and noticed a gold signet ring on her pinky that you hadn’t fully appreciated previously. It had some kind of crest or emblem on it.

“What’s this?” you asked, moving your hand atop hers, turning it so you could look at the ring more closely.

It looked old. The ornately-engraved central motif was a large oak tree bedecked with acorns, its trunk circled by three stacked crowns. A scroll was etched below, surrounding the bottom third of the tree, with three tiny words carved within that were too small to read from this distance.

She glanced down at her hand. “Oh, this? It’s uhhhm…” she sighed. “It’s something my dad… left me.” Her expression changed, voice a bit detached and sombre.

“Oh, shit, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean…” you felt supremely crappy for accidentally bringing up something so difficult in this otherwise-easy moment.

“It’s ok. I mean… it sucks, but he—he died a while ago. When I was 18 maybe? I forget I’m wearing it sometimes, I’m just so used to it now. But when he—passed—” she paused awkwardly around the word, “it was like, really hard. And so this,” she swallowed, and fidgeted with the ring between her thumb and forefinger, “it kinda helped me stay connected to him.” She sighed softly.

“I’m so sorry, Abby. That’s must have been really difficult to go through so young,” you said quietly.

“No, look, it’s ok. Well, it’s not ok I guess, but—it’s good to remember him,” she said, forcing herself to smile—but you could sense the hurt and the loss behind her words.

You put your hand against her chest, and smoothed it back and forth above her heart. She covered your hand with hers again, eyes looking thoughtfully towards the window. After a few quiet minutes, her mood having softened, she looked back towards you.

“Sooo, what were we talking about again, before I made it super-awkward?” you grimaced, hoping to break the tension a little.

“I believe we were mocking me because I liked being fucked by you?” she grinned, teasing you. You scrunched your eyes, cringing at yourself, and she laughed. “But really, I’m not kidding,” she continued, matter-of-factly, “it’s usually—*usually*—very hard for me to come. And that’s on the rare occasion when I even allow people to try.”

“Oooh, I feel special, I must have a gift,” you chuffed, waggling your fingers enthusiastically on her chest. “No, but seriously, why would you deny yourself the pleasure?”

“Hmmm, it’s not that…” she looked thoughtful, “I guess it’s just too fucking hard sometimes? Like, people see me and I’m the big, tanky, thirst trap, I guess, and they just want me to rail them.” You laughed at this, and gave her a falsely-sympathetic look fused with the disbelief that she knew how comprehensively stunning she was to look at. She shrugged unapologetically, smirking, and continued. “Like, don’t get me wrong—I absolutely *love* topping, it’s hella fun, and I’m pretty damned good at it, if I do say so myself—” those eyebrows again, and you rolled your eyes, mocking her cockiness, ”but… most people don’t really read me right. Cuz yeah, I absolutely *love* fucking the hell out of someone, but, I really enjoy the… the teasing, too; the… withholding. And it’s just, people rarely try to assert any kind of authority over me like you did…” her voice trailed off hesitantly, a bashful look on her face and her eyes scrunching with the slightest hint of shyness, as if she’d just let out a secret that very few people knew.

“Oh, so you *like* being pushed around a little, huh?” you concluded, with knowing eyes and a pleased little smirk on your face. “Good to know. Toppy Abby likes to be topped,” you teased, nodding, and storing that little factoid away for later.

“Hey, hey—I wouldn’t go quite *that* far,” she backpedaled quickly, trying to regain control of the situation, “there’s only room for one certified top in this bed,” and she rolled you both over so her weight was on you, propping herself up with her forearms either side of her head, as she began feasting on your neck again in a display of playful dominance.

“Mmm-hmm, sure, yup. Got it, you’re the boss, boss,” you saluted, snorting derisively, which yielded an annoyed scoff from her that was quickly followed by a slightly abashed smile. You looked at her, thinking, \*as if I didn’t just completely take control of your cunt, and fuck you till you screamed—\*but you decided to keep that to yourself for now, and allow her to carry on kissing you.

“So—” you started, as she continued kissing enthusiastically at your neck, “I have a thing—a work thing—this afternoon, that I need to get back to the city for,” a resigned look on your face.

“The city, as in…?”

“Boston,” you responded. “It’s about a 3 hour drive from here.”

“Oh, I mean, that’s where I work, too. I’m going back today as well. I have a—a meeting thing myself. You want a lift?” she offered.

“Thanks, buuuuut, I need to go back to my place—the cabin I mean—and get some stuff; have a shower; wipe the freshly-fucked look of my face—you know, be a generally presentable and put-together human,” you teased.

She smiled, delighted at your words, kisses now journeying up to your earlobe. “I dunno… I mean, I think you look pretty presentable right *now*, though…” she purred low in your ear, before working the lobe with her teeth.

“Pfffft, stop it! Fuck, this is so unfair, you’re too attractive. How am I supposed to resist when you’re doing things like that to me?!” you whined, chuckling.

“Ok, well then,” she sat up, a thoughtful look across her features, “What time do you need to be in Boston?”

“4 o’clock?” you pondered aloud, “Hmm, actually, probably more like 3:30.”

“Ok, well, that’s about the same time as me. So if I get you back to the Williams place by 11am, that should be plenty of time for you to do whatever you need to do, and then drive to Boston whenever you’re ready, right?”

“I mean, I guess so? Why…?” you asked, curiously.

“Well, it’s probably like 8:30 or something now. What if I get up, feed Bear, bring you something to eat—” further wet kisses played against your neck, as her hand now glided sensually over your stomach, on an unerring path down to your heat—”and then… if you’re up for it… I could make you come on my mouth?” She let two thick fingers drop into your wetness, immediately finding your clit and rubbing small, firm circles, as her teeth brushed against your neck. You gasped, completely unprepared, but then moaned softly as she kept going. “After all, I’m yet to fulfil the promise I made you last night…” her voice drifted off.

“Shit…” you breathed, ready to relinquish your body unto hers. But then, your tummy rumbled loudly, and she chuckled at the sound, hand cupping your cunt with her palm as she did so.

“Oh shut up,” you huffed playfully, pushing her off you. “If you’re going to laugh at my actual hunger, you can go make me some breakfast,” you demanded. “And there better be fruit. And black tea. With milk—*and* sweetener.”

She bit her lip, pleased with her negotiation tactics, and rolled to the side of the bed, fastening a watch around her wrist before bending over to pull on her boxers over that perfectly shaped butt. *Damn, she looks so good shirtless*, you thought.

“And if the tea is acceptable,” you continued, “I might—*might*—consider letting you eat me out,” you sassed, a haughty look on your face.

“Well ok then, be right back for my tea-making assessment,” she winked, striding energetically out of the room, and you could hear the sounds of Bear racing up the stairs to greet her halfway.

\----------

Two hours later, you were in Abby’s latest-model Jeep, Bear secured in the back seat behind you, as she drove down the winding dirt road to the Williams’s cabin on the other side of the mountain.

Pink Floyd was playing on the stereo, and Abby, wearing designer sunglasses, her hair now arranged in a messy bun at the back of her head, expertly navigated the car around the potholes that had formed along road from last night’s rain. The way she worked the manual gears with those capable hands was inexplicably hot—*and like, how old-fashioned at the same time,* you thought, because who still drove stick if they could afford a nice car like this?

When she hit a relatively straight stretches of road, Abby would move her hand affectionately to your thigh, giving it a squeeze, and occasionally stealing cute, sidelong glances in your direction when she thought you weren’t looking.

You enjoyed the view beyond the dense pines, thinking about what a surprisingly lovely morning you’d had together. It wasn’t like you’d expected her to be dull or rude, per se, but somehow, your lazy morning fuckfest had been sweet, and hot, and intimate, and really… kinda coupley?

She’d brought you breakfast on a tray, teacup wobbling noisily on the antique saucer as she climbed the stairs slowly and lumbered uncomfortably into the room. Her capability and strength were incontrovertible, and she could swing an axe with precision. But finesse of this kind? Not so much her strong suit. Well, not outside the bedroom, at least.

As you drank your tea wrapped in the blanket (a freshly brewed Americano for her), you munched on the toast she’d brought you, along with a neat little selection of condiments in tiny ceramic dishes: butter, honey, a fancy strawberry preserve, and homemade peanut butter. She ate a bland-looking bowl of muesli with natural yoghurt (”*Why would you do that to your tastebuds?*” you’d teased her).

She asked lots of questions about you, learning that you were a visual designer for work, but that you’d just moved back from Chicago, and that your cabin was full of wood and tools and inks and overpriced paper, all of which you used in pursuit of your passion for printmaking. You showed her some photos of some finished pieces and works-in-progress on your phone, which she’d taken an unexpectedly keen interest in, and then asked her about the woodworking tools on her dresser.

She’d cringed, saying, “*Oh no, I’m really not that good yet,*” but let you pick them up anyway, and told you about the little, incomplete chunks of wood she’d been whittling away at. She was working on getting the shape of a bear just right, and wanted it to be a smaller version of the one her dad had carved that sat on the sideboard across the room. Some of the pieces of wood looked vaguely like a bear, at least, and she said she’s show you her workshop downstairs another time, if you wanted. You’d gulped at those words: ‘*another time’…*

The tools she worked with were an expensive, Swiss-made brand that you knew of, which she’d inherited from her dad. The wooden handles were well-loved, with small-but-insignificant nicks in and stains in places—but all in all, they were so well cared for you couldn’t believe they were fifty-years-old “hand-me-downs”. You contrasted these with the shitty, cheap woodcarving and printmaking tools that you’d only recently replaced with horrifically expensive Japanese ones, and how you’d be paying them off for years to come—but it was “an investment in your future”, you’d told her (and also the reason you were eating tinned soup more often than you wanted to admit). You nervously told her about the exhibition you were hoping to hold sometime in the next year. “*That’s really cool,*” she’d said, sounding impressed by your dedication to it.

When you had asked her what she did for work, she’d been a little dismissive—something about boring, financial consulting things that made rich men even richer—but she said she was good with numbers and strategy, and had work connections through family friends that meant she’d done pretty well early on in her career. She’d bought the cabin with the bonuses she’d saved over the first 10 years of her career along with some of her dad’s inheritance. The financial part of the conversation had, in all honesty, been a bit intimidating, and as an artist-at-heart who’d struggled to make ends meet for the better part of your twenties before achieving the epic goal of Getting Out Of Debt—you merely did your best to look as if you vaguely understood what she was talking about.

She’d told you that, in addition to the tools and the signet ring, most of the furniture in the house had been her dad’s too—which explained the ‘old timey’ aesthetic of the cabin, somewhat—and so had the antique Rolex that had been her grandfather’s and then her father’s, before it became hers. Her mum had died when she was four, so it had just been her and her dad for ages, and he’d been a surgeon and a single dad until he passed, too. She didn’t have any close family that she saw with any meaningful frequency—”Just some cousins in states I hardly visit,”—but her pride and joy was Bear, who was 6 years old, and the apple of her eye. She was totally whipped for him, but also was a strict disciplinarian with his training. He was super-smart, she assured you, and she showed you a bunch of commands he could follow, including some very cute moves like “play dead” and these adorable little rolls he did across the bedroom floor, paws in the air, that made him look extremely derpy.

And that was the only time she’d looked really, genuinely, happy talking about her life: not when she was talking about work, or her family, or even her hobbies—but when she spoke about her “big dumb Bear” as she called him him now, glancing in the rearview mirror affectionately at her boy, and then immediately correcting herself by adding “he’s actually super-smart though,” in case you’d doubted how capable her perfect boy was. And whether by coincidence or intelligence, Bear took exactly that moment to give a proud little woof from the back seat, tail wagging enthusiastically and a big smile on his face as Abby broke into a goofy voice, saying, “Awww is that my big smart Bear? Did you hear your name, buddy? Who’s a good Bear?!” and putting her hand between the front seats to blindly scritch his ears while she kept her eyes responsibly on the road.

Well—there was *another* time she’d looked pretty damned happy, you reminisced, eyes glazing over stupidly as you recalled the multiple orgasms she’d pulled from you after breakfast, absolutely feasting on your cunt until you begged her to stop, before immediately pulling you into the shower to do it all over again, under the tenuous guise of “multitasking”: it was the the kind eye roll-inducing of bs you’d heard consultants say at a few of the places you’d freelanced, and you had never been able to tell if they were serious, full of shit, or a bit of both at the same time. Either way, Abby had railed you all morning, a satisfied smirk on her face the entire time—and she was so fucking good at it that you would one hundred per cent give her a trophy if the right opportunity ever presented itself.

Your brought yourself back to reality, however, as you gazed out the window. You’d known this woman for less than 24 hours. *Was she like this with all of the “guests” who stayed over?* you wondered. Was she just selling you a persona she’d brought out a hundred times, only to give you a fake number and then avoid you every time you ran into one another at the food market at the foot of the mountain? This had been an unexpected night, and Abby had been charming, and incredible in bed, and really fun to get to know—but you were almost certain that she’d pull up at the end of the road to your cabin in about thirty seconds, and this would be the last you’d ever hear from her, awkward grocery store run-ins aside.

She put the jeep into park in the makeshift driveway, a few yards away from the blue all wheel drive wagon you’d bought second-hand when you’d moved back to Boston. It was nothing fancy, but big enough to fit all your art supplies and luggage in the back, and it should be powerful enough to get you through the snow in the winter, assuming the roads were ploughed every few days at least. You’d nicknamed it Sausage, for no reason other than that it made you laugh to say it out loud.

Hand on the door handle, you turned to Abby. “Thanks for driving me back. And the… sleepover. I appreciate it, really,” you smiled, turning away.

“Oh, it’s gonna be like *that* is it?” she smirked, cocking her head and looking at you over the top of her sunglasses, that eyebrow arched again smugly, as you turned back towards her.

“Well—what am I supposed to say?” you asked, a little defensively, shrugging, as though this is just how these things go.

“Youuuu *could* ask for my number,” she suggested, a hint of offence in her tone. Was she annoyed you *hadn’t* asked her?

“Oh, so you were actually gonna call me, huh? So why didn’t *you* ask?” you quizzed, a bit of incredulity coming across, as your own eyebrows were now raised, too.

She looked at you, and took off her glasses, hooking them over the neck of her forest green cable-knit sweater. “Shut up and give me your phone,” she shook her head at you, but she was smiling, trying to ease the tension a bit.

You handed over your phone, watching her as she around swiped at the screen, typing in her number presumably, and then she held the device briefly away from her and made a perfectly sexy face.

“There, all done,” she said, handing the phone back to you. A hot-as-hell selfie of Abby stared back at you from the contact card, a perfect pout on her lips.

“Call it,” she instructed.

“Huh?”

“I mean: call it now. So you know I didn’t put a fake number in there, if that’s what you’re worried about.”

“Why would you have put a fake number in there?” you scoffed, playing it off like the thought had never once entered your mind. She just looked back at you, expectantly, waiting. And so, you hit the call button, and within seconds, the ringer sounded in her car bluetooth.

“Oh, I wonder who that could be,” she said, feigned curiosity and surprise on her face. You rolled your eyes at her, as she pulled her own phone out of her back pocket. “Now it’s your turn,” she said, and then she pulled up the phone camera and pointed the lens at your face.

“What? No!” you immediately went to block the view of your face with your hands.

“Don’t be dumb,” she rolled her eyes at you, now. “You look absolutely gorgeous,” and she said it effortlessly, no pretence or sarcasm in her voice; just her very authentic and matter-of-fact opinion. Your hands dropped, surprised by her sincerity, and you must have been looking at her, lost in your thoughts without realising, a small fire of hope burning inside you that maybe this sexy lumberjack woman *was* really into you—because she pointed the camera at you, and said, “Yeah, that face,” smiling contentedly, and she saved it in her phone before you had a chance to protest.

Shit. You were blushing. *Nononono, not nowwwww, really?*

She smiled at you, that imperceptible look on her face again. “Hey,” she started, reaching towards you with one of her large hands, “C’mere,” and she cupped your face, as your lips floated, seemingly involuntarily, towards hers.

She kissed you sweetly, just a hint of her tongue, pulling away with a final nip of her teeth against your lip.

*Fuckkkkk, what is wrong with meeee?* you screamed internally, in spite of the lurching feeling in your gut and your pants. *This is not going to end well!*

“Chat soon then?” she suggested.

“Yeah, sure, great, ok. That’d be great,” you tripped over your words a little, not used to this kind of direct earnestness off the back of a night like the one you’d just had with her.

You stepped out of the car, remembering to grab your hiking pack and jacket from the back seat, and giving Bear a final affectionate pat in the process.

“See ya, Bear,” you laughed, and he wagged his tail excitedly at you, and licked your hand. “Bye,” you offered a sweet smile as you closed the car door.

You heard Abby’s phone ring through the stereo. She wound down the window, and gave you a charming wink, mouthing ‘*I’ll call you’*, and you gave her a small wave goodbye as she wound up the window, answering the call with the sound of, “Heyyy, Isaac, what’s doing?” before her Jeep pulled out of the drive and down the road.

<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>You attempted to work your features into a semi-neutral visage, but you were about 97% confident you just looked slightly unhinged.
“Um, hi,” you faltered, “it’s uhhh, it’s nice to meet you… Abby,” and while you were speaking in as professional a tone as you could muster, you were certain it was coming across as stilted and awkward.
“Uhhh, hi, hello, hey there,” she responded, also flustered and clearly trying to compose herself.
--
It's your first day of your new contract at FFL&amp;Y consulting, and the client, Isaac, is turning out to be a complete jerk.
To make things worse, it turns out Abby—the same Abby who railed you into oblivion less than 24 hours earlier—is now your new colleague, and she's just undermined you in front of the client.
You're desperate to keep this contract, but that means keeping Abby at arm's length, to ensure you don't get screwed over like you did with your previous office romance. But can you maintain your resolve? And for how long can you resist Abby in a suit...?</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>I’m excited to finally have this ready to go. There’s some key plot moments in this chapter, so it took a bit of extra time as I didn’t want to force the narrative, and open up plot holes later.
No smut in this one, but get ready for angst, though. What’s a smutty love story without some heavy plot here and there to set the scene for some good make-up sex later, right?!
But we finally get to meet some more of the Salt Lake crew!</p>
<p>Chapter Notes for every character not named Owen or Mel: *[Elaborate backstory on their personality, goals, strengths, weaknesses, and how they know Abby]*</p>
<p>Chapter Notes for Owen: *Khakis and boring sweaters.*</p>
<p>Chapter Notes for Mel: *Beige turtleneck sweater dress.*</p>
<p>It’s not that I hate them… I just found their whole plotline from the game gave me the irrits.
I also had a lot of fun turning misogynist-vibes Jordan into an enby queer with a bisexual haircut. ENJOY!

*Fuck. Did I check the kitchen bench? How are they not there? Where the fuck are they?*

You picked up a pile of stuff from the kitchen counter that was comprised mostly of concept sketches, receipts, and a few unpaid bills. Nope, no keys under there.

You looked at your phone. It was 12:37pm. Your first client meeting was at 4pm. The drive was about 3 hours, assuming traffic was fair, so you were cutting it pretty fine.

But where the fuck were your car keys?

You went to the big, wooden table that had been pushed up against the far window overlooking the mountainside below, and started rifling through sketchbooks and moving multiple jars of printing ink to see if you’d left your car keys there prior to setting off on your hike the day before.

The hike that led you to the cabin—and the bed—of Abby no-last-name, the complete snacc of a Lumberjack and sex god.

*NOT NOW, BRAIN!* you scolded yourself, as bits of paper fell from your desk to the floor as you searched.

“*Hnnngh! Where the hell are they?*” you grunted your frustration into the quiet of the small cabin living room.

You thought hard. What happened yesterday before the hike? You went to get groceries, you came home, put your groceries away, packed your hiking pack… oh.

You rolled your eyes and clenched your teeth, and went to the coat hooks by the front door, fumbling around in the pocket of your old black puffer jacket, and—

*Voila*. Car keys.

“Cool cool cool cool, not running late at all for my first meeting with this new client, everything’s just fiiiiiine,” you murmured to yourself sarcastically, grabbing your just-about-corporate-friendly-if-not-a-little-beaten-up tan leather satchel, hauling it over your shoulder, and thankfully remembering your thermos of tea on the kitchen counter before heading to the car.

Three hours, a whole bunch of podcasts, and some moderate traffic later you and your car, Sausage, were only a few blocks from the piers where your new client’s office was located. You should make it on time, with any luck, assuming parking wasn’t too hard to come by. You saw a giant FFL&Y logo plastered in across the top of the swankiest looking building on the waterfront, and managed to nab a park right out the front of the office. The hourly parking fee was obscene, but you were running so late that you really didn’t care anymore. You paid, grabbed your satchel, and headed into the foyer.

You walked into the lobby and your eyes bulged. You’d worked for some pretty big clients with fancy offices before—advertising agencies, banks, legal offices, and the like—but this place was on another level. A soaring ceiling with a massive modernist glass chandelier towered over shiny marble floors. Minimalist leather sofas and arm chairs were arranged around huge coffee tables in the waiting area where a bunch of young people looking fresh out of college and in their first business suits were seated, probably nervously awaiting interviews for grad roles or similar. At the back of the lobby, past some security-gated elevators on either side of the foyer, was a coffee cart overlooking the waterfront. It was surrounded by consultant types in much fancier-looking suits, all with perfectly coiffed hair, the noise of their expensive shoes echoing on the tiles and the chasmic ceiling, all playing out against a backing track of the barista making coffee.

This diorama of ostentatious wealth made you cringe.

You felt comparatively underdressed, even though you’d come outfitted one of your nicer button-downs featuring a liberty print in hues of blue, purple and yellow, and a foresty-green tweed blazer. *Thank god I wore my good jeans, at least*, you thought, though you really wished you’d polished your not-so-shiny brown dress shoes now.

“You’re doing this to pay for the exhibition,” you reminded yourself under your breath, as you headed towards the front desk. Sitting behind a computer at the enclosed service desk was an immaculately dressed person in a tweed suit, a brightly patterned cravat and the most delightfully bisexual hair—long on one side, shaved up to the part on the other.

“Afternoon, how may I be of assistance?” a campy masculine voice greeted you warmly, eyes sparkling.

“Uhhh… I’m here for a 4pm with… Owen Moore? It’s for the Washington Liberty Financial meeting.”

“Sure thing, you must be the designer Owen mentioned…” they looked at their computer, checking your face against the picture on their screen, “yep, it’s a match, nice photo by the way,” they made a little face of approval at you. “Hold on, I’ll let him know you’ve arrived. He’ll have to come collect you—security protocol,” they gestured to the two security guards at the entrance gates in front of the elevators.

“Oh, yeah, no problem.”

You moved to the side of the service desk, put your satchel by your feet, and leaned your elbow against the mahogany counter while you looked around the lobby, taking in the high ceilings again.

“First time here?” they asked, typing away in the background.

“Um, yeah… is it obvious?” you smiled sheepishly.

“Well, you don’t look like you have a giant stick up your ass like most of the people who work here,” they said in a stealthy tone, and winked at you. You repressed a giggle, your mouth stretching into a restrained grin. “It’s ok,” they said, “not everyone here is an entitled rich capitalist—that Owen guy you’re meeting is pretty nice. Brings me coffee sometimes.”

“Oh, phew. I was starting to regret taking the contract. This lobby is… obscene,” you finished, looking around. “I’m selling my soul for my art, you see.”

“Oh, honey, aren’t we all, or why else would good people like us be here?” they said, putting a hand to their face and drumming their long fingernails on their cheekbone. “Seeing as you’ll be here a while by the sounds—I’m Jordan.” Jordan held out their hand daintily to shake your hand.

“It’s great to meet, you Jordan. Thanks for the welcome. Honestly.” You smiled warmly at them, and they beamed sweetly back. Having even one nice person at your workplace made all the difference when freelancing.

“Oh, that’s Owen right now,” Jordan gestured towards the security gates.

A voice called from behind you. “Hey, great to have you here!” You turned towards the voice and a thirty-something guy you recognised from your video call last week strolled towards you. He was dressed in khakis, a comfy wool sweater in mottled shades of brown, chambray shirt lapels peeking from below it, and a heavily-patterned brown tie. Thankfully, he didn’t look nearly as intimidating as all the people by the coffee cart. “Thanks so much, Jordan—did you meet—?”

“Oh yeah,” Jordan chucked, batting a hand at Owen and throwing a friendly smile at you in jest, “we go way back.”

“Of course you two have met, all that creative… whatsit… energy?” Owen was awkward, and trying his best to be genial, though he was obviously in a bit of a rush.

“Oh, Owen, how do you constantly sound like you’re a thousand years old,” Jordan rolled their eyes at him, then smiled. “Please don’t scare this one away,” they said, gesturing at you, “they’re the first nice person I’ve checked in this *whole week*.” As they spoke, Jordan was clicking away at the computer, and then a small printer next to them whirred to life.

“Don’t I know it,” Owen said under his breath. “Hey, Isaac Dixon from Washington Liberty Financial should be here around 4:25. I’ll send Mel down to meet him so he doesn’t have to wait. Can you make sure to have an Americano ready for him when he gets here?”

“Oh, *him*? Ugh,” Jordan sneered, a look of disdain on their face as they pulled an ID card with your photo on it out of the printer, and attached it to a lanyard. “Doesn’t he normally go skiing in Switzerland this time of year? I thought we were done with him after the—”

Owen cut across them. “Yeah, look, I know, he’s a lot. But just have the coffee ready. You know how he likes it right?”

“Yeahhhh, yeahhhh,” Jordan sighed, exasperated, and they passed you the lanyard with your access card.

“Okay!” Owen turned to you, “Let’s get moving, I wanna run you through a few things before we meet with Isaac.”

“Thanks again, Jordan,” you waved them a little farewell.

“Good luck—though I’m sure you’ll *slay*,” they said the last bit so that only you could hear, and winked again.

“Thankyou!” You mouthed hopefully at them, and turned around to follow Owen to the Elevators.

Fifteen minutes later, you’d been shown to your desk on the 4th floor that had a panoramic view of Boston Harbour and Jeffries Point. Owen had started showing you around, explaining that this floor was dedicated to teams that dealt with financial consulting work—”Mergers, acquisitions, financial modelling and strategic advice, that kinda stuff,”—and took you to meet some of the people you’d be working with. **Ugh, great, a finance project**, *no wonder the background checks had been so over the top,* you groaned internally. Finance work was usually dry as hell, and the clients, more often than not, were total pedants.

The floor was reasonably busy, with a few dozen consultants on video calls, and large televisions everywhere playing various business news channels on mute. He introduced you to a petite woman with a pixie cut, a Risk Management Consultant named Mel. She was dressed somewhat stuffily in a beige turtleneck sweaterdress that showed her visibly-pregnant belly, with a long flowing, grey marl cardigan over the top. She was short and brisk with Owen, but perfectly friendly to you, saying how glad she was to have new designer on the team for “a project this critical,” and that Isaac “likes to test new people, so don’t take it personally if he’s a bit brash.”

What the hell was this project everyone was so antsy about, and who the hell was this Isaac guy? He sounded like an old client you’d butted heads with at a job a few years back—a pretentious marketing exec who paid a fortune for your strategic advice and design work, and then overruled you at the last minute because he was so uncomfortable that things weren’t done 100% the way he wanted them to be. A week of all-nighters later, and completely exhausted, you’d lost it at him in a meeting. *Surely this wouldn’t be as bad as that, right…?* you hoped internally.

Owen continued showing you around the office, now walking you past a row of fancy offices on the far end of the floor with big, glass windows inside and out and picturesque views of the waterfront.

“These are all the exec offices are. This is Manny’s,” he gestured to an untidy office, and you saw a large desk piled with sticky-note-covered paperwork, and dirty coffee mugs scattered about. There were bits of photography equipment atop a bookshelf on one side of the room, and a tennis racket balancing on the arm of the sofa. “Manny’s office is always a bit… well,” Owen made apologetic eyes. “You might not meet him today, but he’s in legal, and tends to get involved with work of this kind.”

He continued his tour. “This is Anderson’s office. She’ll be in the WLF meeting with us. She’s meant to be here already, but she had an errand to run on the way back from another meeting.” This office couldn’t be more different from the last: it was sparse, neatly organised, stationery contained tidily in a silver pencil holder on the oak desk, books arranged by topic on the bookshelves, and there was a baseball mitt with a baseball in it to one side, too. “She can be a bit… serious and standoffish with new people. She’s smart as hell, though, one of our most-talented economists and the youngest woman to make partner at FFL&Y—and she’s worked with Isaac for years, so he requested her specifically for this one.”

“And this,” he gestured to the next, much larger office along, “is Nora’s. She’s the Managing Partner for Finance.” He tapped on the glass door with his knuckles, and a woman behind a large desk at the far end of the office gestured for you to come in. She was wearing a flowing silk blouse with pussycat bow featuring large irregular spots in shades of red, crimson and orange. Her dark brown natural hair was styled in curly bangs, and yellow and gold dangly earrings peaked through the curls.

“Hey, Nora, sorry to bother you—” Owen started.

“It’s no sweat, Owen. Is this our new designer for the WLF work?” Nora asked.

“Yeah, hey, nice to meet you,” you extending a hand, moving forward to introduce yourself.

“Great to have you on board,” Nora smiled, and she turned to Owen, “You all ready for the first meeting on Project Island for Isaac?”

“Yeah absolutely, room’s all set up and we’re ready to get started,” he replied.

“Excellent, I have a quick call to make, but I’ll see you in there in five. I want to be here for this kickoff meeting with Isaac, after how… the last piece of work went, I think it’s for the best.”

“Sounds good, couldn’t agree more. Thanks Nora.”

The boardroom appeared to be the biggest meeting room on the Finance floor which Owen told you was reserved for the most important clients of the business, and sat at the opposite end to the private offices. Water glasses and pitchers were already set up on the large table, along with an assortment of fresh fruit and pastries. A massive flatscreen TV was mounted on one wall, and Owen was connecting his laptop to the AV facilities.

You were seated facing the rest of the office, the harbour view at your back, and you poured yourself a glass of water and nibbled at some grapes. A few minutes later, Mel appeared, chatting jovially with someone, her bright laugh carrying ahead of her into the boardroom. You got to your feet.

“Heyyyy, Owen, good to see you again,” said a quiet but commanding baritone voice. It was an older man with short, curly, grey-brown hair wearing a grey tailored suit jacket over a fine black wool sweater, neat dark blue denim jeans, and brown suede desert boots. He was very tall, over six feet you guessed, and had an imposing build.

“Great to see you again, sir,” Owen replied.

“Owen, I tell you every time—it’s *Isaac*,” he said in low chuckle that was probably intended to be congenial, but was somehow still unmistakably authoritative. He turned to face you now, appraising you briefly with his eyes. “And you must be our new designer,” he said, and there was a smile on his face, but his eyes were steady and unreadable.

“Nice to meet you,” you started, reaching towards him with your outstretched hand, “I’m—”

He cut you off. “I know who you are. Got my EA, Danny, to brief me on the way over. I’m sure you understand, this is a big project for Washington Liberty, and so I had him review all the candidates Owen provided.” He shook your hand, much more firmly than he needed to. “I liked your work for Dyson and Johns Hopkins, though I’m not sure I agreed with your approach for GE.” His smile was still broad, but his voice had a patronising tone to it, and his eyes remained steady and unreadable, as if waiting to see how you would react.

*How the hell am I supposed to respond to that?* His condescending ‘critique’ of your work immediately surfaced a modicum of defensiveness within, and if you were being perfectly honest with yourself—a not-so-small pile of insecurities, also.

*Hey, chill,* you reassured yourself, *as if this guy knows all the details of your work with past clients sufficiently enough to have a fully-informed opinion.* You steeled yourself for the meeting ahead reminding yourself of something your therapist had said the week prior: “**You can’t control what others think of your work, but you can can control that you do it to the best of your ability given the context.**

And with that thought, you squished down your agitation, put your most congenial smile on your face, and said, as courteously as you possibly could, “It was a complicated brief, for sure, but I definitely believe there’s always something we can learn from every project.”

“Well said,” he responded loftily, his hands now in the pockets of his jeans, he turned to seat himself at the head of the table. He turned to Owen. “You ready to go? Where’s Anderson?” Damn, you could tell already this guy liked to be in control.

“She’s uhhh,” he looked looked at his phone to see if she’d sent an update, “she told me about 15 minutes ago that she’s stuck in some pretty bad traffic,” Owen responded, less composure in his voice than was probably needed at this precise moment in time. Isaac looked displeased with his answer.

“I told you, Owen, I have 45 minutes today only, and you’ve already lost five of them,” he said stiffly. “Surely she’s not the only one who can talk to your approach?”

Owen gasped like a goldfish, trying to find the right response to de-escalate, when Nora walked into the room, and Isaac immediately turned to face her. In the brief moment it took her to move from the door to where Isaac sat at the head of the table, she’d already read Owen’s face over Isaac’s shoulder, which without a doubt pleaded, “Help me, please?”

“Isaaaaaac, sorry I’m a few minutes late, I was on the phone to the Salt Lake office,” Nora’s voice was upbeat, energetic and reassuring, and he rose warmly to greet her.

“Nora! I was hoping I’d get to see today,” he returned, “How’s your wife’s doctorate going at MIT?”

“Oh you know how research is—dead end after dead end, until you hit a breakthrough.” Nora was clearly an expert at taking a tough situation and framing it in a good light. “She’s awaiting some results from a big study this week, though, and she’s feeling cautiously optimistic,” and Isaac nodded with interest at this. “She told me to say that you’re welcome to pop by the lab on Friday if you’re free. They’re doing a big walk-through for potential investors from three til five.”

“Okay, I *might* just do that—as long as she has those Biscoff cookies she knows I love so much,” and he raised his eyebrows expectantly.

“Oh, I’m sure she can find time to whip up a batch before then, only because it’s you, of course,” Nora beamed.

The casual nepotism of it all made you cringe again. **Neutral face, neutral face,** you implored yourself.

“Speaking of—” Nora redirected the conversation, “How’s everything going here? Abby will be here shortly. I know how excited she is by the opportunity to collaborate with you on this.”

*Huh, two new Abbys in one week, what are the odds?* you thought, remembering that lingering kiss from this morning in the Jeep before she drove off into the sunset.

“Abby, excited about work?” Mel derided with a quick glance around the room, but Isaac coughed uncomfortably and Nora shot her a brief but serious look. Mel adjusted her posture, immediate regret on her face. Now was clearly not the time to do anything that would undermine Isaac’s self-importance.

“Mel, why don’t you get things started. I know you are as across the work as Abby,” Nora smiled broadly at Mel, who looked did a double take, and Owen looked sideways at Nora.

Mel responded, “Me? I—“ and you were sure you saw a flash of a look in Nora’s eyes that said **And if you’re not across things, Mel, you’d better make us look good anyway.** Mel gathered herself. “Of course I am,” she smiled, and it was sufficiently convincing. “Let me just connect to the screen.”

Mel started going through the slide pack the team had created, and for the most part, was holding her own—or at least, it seemed that way to you, less than 1 hour into this project.

Most of what she presented was introductory stuff about the work to be done. Isaac was making a push into the medical technology space, and seeking to get investors onboard to raise startup capital. He had seed-funded a small team of researchers out of Stanford who were working on some “cutting edge tech that will completely change the way lab testing is conducted for consumers,” as Isaac had extolled emphatically, talking you all through the data sets and convoluted technical diagrams the research team had provided that were currently displayed on the big flatscreen.

You tried to look impressed, but you were mostly just trying to stay across the key points so you could get the info you needed to do your part of the work effectively. The task at hand for the FFL&Y team—which now included *you*—was to pull together the investor pack for the start-up to attract additional investment capital.

”We need to make it as *simple as possible* for people to make sense of the science and the innovation we’ll be bringing to the space,” Isaac stressed, “there’s nothing that makes investors more insecure than being made to feel stupid.”

Mel’s hand went to her chin, and eyebrows furrowed, as she considered the options. “Well… I suppose I could try and find ways to simplify the data sets to show things like time, cost, and resource expenditure without the tech, and how that changes based on the new tech you’re introducing,” Mel pondered aloud. “And I’m sure that we could use some visual polish at the end to make it look nice,” and she gestured towards you.

***Yeah, that’s all the designer is here for, right? To make things look pretty,*** you thought, a little irritated. This was a common thing said in passing at meetings, but it never got less frustrating to be thought of as the person who’s brought in at the last minute to clean up everyone else’s poorly-communicated content.

“It still needs to be technically impressive though,” Isaac responded to Mel, “so we can’t dumb it down too much—we need to let the science tell the story,” Isaac responded, sounding impressed with where all this was going. Nora nodded thoughtfully.

You pulled out a stylus from your pocket, and brought up a sketching app on the iPad you were using for note-taking. Eyes narrowed and lips pressed together in concentration, you started drawing out some rough sketches that could communicate the information displayed on the big screen more visually.

While you were busily scribbling away, Mel brought up some examples of work she’d done for other clients where she’d been able to pare back complex data to a few key numbers, while extolling the “significant impact it made” for the clients in question.

And while what Mel was saying made sense at a surface level—based on your experience, you knew that technical jargon and complex data at any level tended to *overwhelm* people, rather than help communicate—especially if they weren’t thoughtfully considered from the outset. You gestured in Mel’s direction, trying to find the right time to intervene, but she was looking between Isaac and her examples on-screen, and was missing your cues. For ten minutes you’d waited patiently for an opening, but she just kept going and going, and you realised you would have to cut in if you wanted to to contribute.

“Sorry to interrupt, Mel,” and while you mustered as friendly a voice as you could, she looked nonetheless peeved that you’d interrupted her soliloquy. “I’d love to share some sketches that illustrate how we could take your suggestion even further. Okay if I cast my tablet to the screen for a moment?”

“Maybe we can get back to those later—” she started dismissively, but Isaac spoke over her.

“No, let’s look now, while we’re on the topic. I don’t want to be going back and forth,” Isaac’s voice was authoritative and you could see Mel’s face bristling. Nora and Owen, on the other hand, seemed impressed by the initiative you were showing, and both looked on with interest to see what you were going to share.

Mel disconnected her laptop and you cast your tablet to the screen, showing a series of small, rough, illustrations that visually communicated how the proposed solution could skip several steps in an otherwise-long process.

“Hmm, this might not be a bad idea, and it could certainly make the pack more dynamic and engaging,” Isaac was thoughtfully considering what you’d shared, while Mel looked more annoyed that you were continuing to steal her thunder, “but how will you make sure that it’s still comprehensive enough to impress the investors?”

“Let me bring up some examples from the work I did for Dyson and Johns Hopkins,” you suggested, “I’ll just grab my laptop.” As you bent down to open your satchel and retrieve your Macbook, the door at the back of the room opened noisily.

“Apologies, team; good to see you, Isaac,” a confident and assertive voice spoke, and it seemed confusingly familiar.

“Abbyyyy, good to see you,” Isaac’s face lit up warmly, as he immediately stood and moved towards the tall, broad-shouldered figure to shake their hand, obscuring them from your line of sight.

*Abby? What?! Y\_our mind was racing. You sat up holding your laptop, and cast your eyes towards the figure, desperately trying to see the person’s face between Isaac’s large frame and Mel’s head. \_No, it can’t be, there’s no way it’s her,* you pleaded internally.

As the besuited figure moved towards the table, they continued facing Isaac, so their back was to you while they moved to sit beside Mel, across the table from you. But you noticed their blonde hair tied up in a mostly-tidy but casual bun.

“I had to drop Bear off at his dog sitter’s place on the way back from a client meeting, and the traffic was crazy,” she said.

You were aware that Isaac said something in response, but you didn’t really hear his words, because you were too busy freaking the fuck out.

*Bear?!! Oh god, this can’t be happening.* You were panicking. This cannot be the person you just spent the night getting absolutely railed by; the universe would not be that cruel, would it?

And then she turned, as if in slow motion to address the rest of the room, eyes moving from Isaac, to Nora, to Owen, and Owen spoke, addressing her: “Abby, this is the designer I told you about who’ll be supporting you and Mel on the project,” and he gestured a hand towards you in introduction, “and this,” he gestured towards her now, “is Abby Anderson, who will be handling the financial modelling and investor acquisition strategy.”

When she turned to look at you, her eyes goggled in restrained surprise as she took in your face, eyebrows knitting together momentarily as she made sense of who was sitting before her.

You tried your best to stay calm and quiet your noisy thoughts, but your heart was absolutely racing, and not in a good way.

**Fuck fuck fuck fuck.**

You attempted to work your features into a semi-neutral visage, but you were about 97% confident you just looked slightly unhinged.

“Um, hi,” you faltered, “it’s uhhh, it’s nice to meet you… Abby,” and while you were speaking in as professional a tone as you could muster, you were certain it was coming across as stilted and awkward.

“Uhhh, hi, hello, hey there,” she responded, also flustered and clearly trying to compose herself.

**Don’t think about her fucking you, don’t think about her fucking you,** you pleaded with your brain.

Everyone else around the table was looking between yourself and Abby, trying to figure out why you were both being weird.

“Everything ok, Abby?” Nora asked brows furrowed in mild concern at the awkwardness between the two of you.

“Yeah. *Yeah*,” she seemed to compose herself, trying to pass the situation off as a misunderstanding, “of course, sorry, just a bit stressed out from driving so much today,” and she smiled as casually as she could, and forced a laugh. This seemed to settle everyone down, so you gulped, and tried to do the same. “So where were we?” she asked, trying to move things along. Her eyes flitted to yours and when you caught her looking you could’ve sworn a touch of crimson flash across her cheeks. She turned immediately towards Owen as he began a brief recap of what had been discussed to this point.

You genuinely tried to listen, but in all honestly, you heard nothing of the summary Owen was giving Abby. You were too busy trying not to look across the table at her, which was extraordinarily difficult, because she looked so damned fine.

She was wearing a finely-tailored business suit in a subtly-textured navy blue fabric that showed off the breadth of those shoulders. The crisp, perfectly white business shirt underneath was cut meticulously and casually undone at the collar just enough to show off the clavicles that you had kissed less than 12 hours prior. A bright yellow silk pocket square was casually arranged in the top pocket of her jacket, and her large hands were interlaced on the table in front of her, a vein or two protruding from the taught skin. She looked so incredibly handsome and beautiful all at the same time that it made your mouth water.

“And now we’re just looking at some ideas for how we could keep the technical information a bit more accessible for non-techy people,” Owen finished, before turning towards you expectantly.

Everyone was looking at you. You were looking at Abby’s hands, remembering the things she had done to you with those hands.

“Sorry, pardon?” you said, face flushed a little, blinking and shaking your head to break your sex-tinged reverie.

“Uhhh, the sketches you were about to show us..?” Owen replied with an expectant nod.

“Oh, yes, of course,” and you cast the old drawings and final illustrations from the Dyson project on your MacBook to the screen.

Everyone seemed impressed with what you shared, and considering how flustered you were mere minutes ago, you felt you did a great job of speaking to the different approaches you’d explored: how the illustrations complemented the written content, and how you’d been able to test the diagrams discretely with people in a way that didn’t give away trade secrets prior to the launch of the products. Abby was regarding your work thoughtfully, and even Isaac seemed satisfied with what you were sharing.

“Mmm, yes, this could be suitable,” he said, seemingly thinking aloud. Nora looked pleased.

“That’s great to hear. I think this will be a really effective approach for what you’re seeking,” you assured him, “I’ll need time with your researchers to—“

“Absolutely not,” he responded. “I need the researchers focused on progressing the tech.”

You looked at him, disconcerted. “It doesn’t have to be much time,” you assured him, “even just an hour would be helpf-“

“No,” he responded, face uncompromising. You furrowed your eyebrows, a confused look on your face, and you looked at Owen, eyes seeking for him to back you up.

But Abby cut in, instead. “It’ll be fine, Isaac, we’ll make it work. Can they send us some annotated sketches?”

*This is so inefficient*, you thought, frustration brimming. “Isaac, I completely understand your apprehension, but even thirty minutes would minimise days or even a week of rework—“ you blurted out.

Isaac glared at you, cutting you off again. “I *said* no.” And his eyes were dark now, all the false congeniality that he’d worn earlier completely gone. “They’ll supply annotated sketches. That should be more than sufficient,” he finished quietly, eyes cold, and he had turned away from you, and was speaking directly to Abby now.

“Of course, Isaac. We’ll provide a brief by email of what’s needed,” she reassured him calmly, nodding, and when he turned to look to Nora, Abby looked at you earnestly, her eyes warning you against pushing Isaac further, as her hands gestured subtly to drop it.

You looked back at her, and the look on your face that was a mix of annoyance and disappointment must have been impossible to miss. She responded by making that unreadable face at you that you’d seen a few times the previous night. It confused the hell out of you, and so you shook your head and looked away, jaw clenched in silent frustration.

Owen spoke, trying to keep things on track. “Abby, I think it would be helpful to take Isaac through the early investment model drafts,” and his voice was affable, trying to settle the tension in the room.

“Sure thing,” Abby carried on, without missing a beat, “Isaac, I sent these breakdowns to you this afternoon, but I want to take you through things in a little more detail,” and her voice was easy and confident, reminiscent of when you’d first met her a mere twenty-four hours ago in the clearing outside her cabin.

And as she talked through the numbers with Isaac—even though you were still annoyed by Isaac’s decision to block access to the researchers; and at Abby for not backing you up; at and all the unnecessary work you *knew* this would result in—it was hard not to be impressed by Abby in work mode. The sheer capability of this woman was definitely a turn-on, and this completely this bugged the shit out of you.

She had this tendency to furrow her brows in concentration whenever she noticed Isaac’s expression looking dissatisfied or confused, and she would adjust her explanation to simplify the concepts so he grasped the rationale fully before moving on.

When Mel chimed in on occasion with ‘helpful questions’ that undermined Abby’s recommendations, Abby would rebuff her effortlessly with something like: “Yes, I investigated that option, and the numbers don’t demonstrate consistent growth.”

On a different occasion, she employed brutal honesty: “No, that’s incorrect, Mel—you’ve not accounted for investment returns with that approach and it undermines long-term fiscal sustainability.” Mel was really turning out to be a bit of a patronising kiss-ass, so watching Abby cut down Mel’s attempts to make herself look like she knew more about Abby’s field of expertise than Abby herself was more satisfying than you would like to admit. You had to bite the inside of your cheeks on more than one occasion to prevent yourself smirking when Mel’s look of superiority was wiped cleanly off her face by Abby’s retorts.

After about fifteen minutes, Abby wrapped up her explanation of the financials by letting Isaac know what was required from him to progress things.

“Sounds acceptable. I look over the numbers later this week, and get them back to you Monday,” he responded matter-of-factly.

“Good, and just reach out if you have any questions,” she finished, turning to Owen and Nora, and completely ignoring Mel. “We good here, then?”

“Yeah, I think so,” Owen smiled, pleased that things had finished on a strong note. “We’ll get that email for the researchers over to you by close of business tomorrow.”

“Make it lunchtime,” Isaac replied, and his face made it clear it was not up for debate.

“Of course, Isaac,” Abby smiled calmly, turning to you and nodding, encouraging your agreement. You grimaced giving her a brusque but cordial nod before turning away to put your laptop back in your satchel, gritting your teeth in rage the second your back was turned.

How the hell would you know whether or not you’d have all the information required to provide the requirements to the researchers by midday tomorrow? You hadn’t even been provided the project documents yet!

This was turning out to be like Johns Hopkins debacle all over again: project leads overpromising unreasonable work in unreasonable deadlines. *This Isaac guy is a complete ass*, you thought, and Abby wasn’t helping things by agreeing to his unreasonable demands without checking with you first.

You mustered your best neutral face, and went to stand next to Owen as the usual post-meeting handshakes ensued, Isaac giving you a curt, “Good to meet you,” and smiling with forced congeniality again.

“Yes, great to meet you,” you replied as politely as possible, “I’m looking forward to working with you and the team.” **God, I hope that was somewhat convincing,** you thought. Isaac nodded in response, before he turned to Abby to shake her hand with a warm smile on his face.

“Great to see you, Isaac, say hi to Danny for me,” she said, as Isaac clapped her on the shoulder with his other hand.

“Will do, Anderson,” he said, as Owen led him out.

The second he was gone, Abby turned towards you and gave you a silent *What are you doing here?* face, and you did a small, confused shrug in response.

“Great work, team,” Nora smiled broadly with open arms as you and Abby both turned to face her. “Nice work on the financials, Abs,” and Abby nodded, “Mel, great job taking the lead at the start,” and Mel looked pleased at the acknowledgement, “And *you!*” she faced you, and clapped her hands together to convey how impressed she was, “Those illustrations were incredible. We really lucked out getting you on the team, and I very much appreciate you jumping in the deep end on day one. Isaac’s not an easy client, I know, but you did great, and he’ll warm up to you in time,” she finished.

Owen reappeared now, having seen Isaac off at the elevators. “Okay, well done, all!” and he shook his fists in celebration of all of you.

“And you too, Owen. Thankyou for getting everything sorted for today,” Nora added. “Ok team, I’ll leave you to it!” She turned to you, “If there’s anything you need, just send me an email—but you’re in good hands with the team,” she reassured you, and then bid you all farewell.

“Y’all good to hang around for a bit of a debrief and next steps?” Owen asked. Mel rolled her eyes at him, but he ignored her.

“Sure, let’s get to it, I have some work to do for my other clients, and I want to get home so I can pick up Bear from Lev’s place,” Abby sighed.

You all filed out of the room and gathered around a large table in the open plan office for about fifteen minutes, talking through the work for tomorrow. Owen shared all the project docs with you, and told you which ones you’d likely need to create the brief for the researchers. The four of you discussed what was needed by when through the week, and Owen said he’d check in with you all along the way. He then excused himself and Mel, saying they had to head off for an appointment. They bickered quietly with one another as they walked towards the elevators.

The office was basically empty except for a few tired-looking consultants at the other end of the floor, fingers drumming away quietly on their laptops. It was just you and Abby up this end of the floor. You both fidgeted with your laptops, pretending to read emails and avoiding eye contact until Mel and Owen had disappeared into an elevator. When they were gone, Abby immediately looked at you over her laptop.

“Are you… okay?” she asked tentatively, eyebrow raised.

You took a deep inhale, thinking. You had no idea how you would get through all this reading and pull together a brief by lunchtime tomorrow without working til late. You previewed the dozen or so docs that Owen had shared with you, and saw that one of them was three hundred and twenty-seven pages long.

You let out a resigned sigh. “Honestly, not really,” you finally replied. “Abby, you can’t promise the client stuff like that without asking me. I can’t get through all this in less than a day. I don’t have any of the context you and Mel have.”

“It’ll be fine, you just need to—” she said, trying to reassure you, but you cut her off.

“No, Abby, it won’t be fine,” and you were probably being more terse than you needed to be, but you were tried and annoyed. “I’ve done this before too, you know, and this is how it always goes on projects like these: the client has stupid deadlines, no-one pushes back, and then I’m the one working til 2am because people constantly underestimate the amount of time design work needs. I’m not just some kind of ‘make it pretty’ button, you know,” your voice was bristling with irritation.

“Hey, I’m just trying to help, you could *calm down* a bit,” she responded, but she immediately knew it was not the right thing to say to you. “Ugh, I didn’t mean it to come out like that—I meant to say—” She was uncharacteristically flustered.

You cut her off again. “*Please* don’t tell me to *calm down.* It’s completely reasonable that I’m pissed right now,” and you clenched your teeth again, barely repressing your rising temper.

“I know, I know, I get it, I’m sorry,” she appealed in earnest, and her face was gentle, eyebrows furrowed, as she tried to de-escalate things between the two of you. She scooted around the end of the table, so she was sitting perpendicular to you. “It’ll be ok, I’ll help you get up to speed—” and she moved to place her hand on yours, and soothed your skin with her thumb.

“What do you think you’re **doing?**” you whispered harshly, as you jerked your hand out from under hers. Your eyes were wide and your response was more combative than was probably necessary. “We—I can’t—*do that* here, I—I can’t *do this*. I’m a **contractor**, Abby. If anyone finds out we hooked up, my contract can be terminated.” You could feel overwhelm and anxiety taking hold, and your voice was panicked. What if Owen or Nora or Mel found out? What if you lost this contract? It would take you weeks to find another contract, and that would eat into your tight budget even more.

Abby was taken aback. “Why are you being like this? Let’s just—let’s talk about this for a second,” she looked genuinely confused, her palms raised.

“Abby, I’m not doing *whatever this is* again, the office romance thing. I’ve done it before and,” your brain flashed back to the Johns Hopkins project again, and the absolutely gorgeous, driven Chief of Surgery—with whom you’d had amazing sex with for months, who’d introduced you to her friends, and taken you to her holiday house by a lake and casually dropped the L-word in a way that had sounded completely sincere—before she’d completely thrown you under the bus to save her own ass when the the Board wasn’t happy with the way the project was going. You shook your head, steeling yourself. “I’ve been through this before, Abby, and it’s… it’s too hard. I just can’t,” you finished. “Could you… please just leave me be so I can get through these documents and go home?”

Abby looked at you, confusion knitting her eyebrows together as she looked at you. “I…” she started, and then she let out a small, despondent sigh. “What can I do? How can I help?” she asked, and her face looked sincere, but you couldn’t risk it.

All you could think to do right now was to go into hyper-focus mode and get started reading the documents so you could get the brief written in time.

You cast your eyes down at your hands, which were poised over the keyboard of your laptop, mouth open a little. You took a sharp inhale, and then your breath coming out in an exhausted huff. “Just… *please* Abby\*—\*let me get through these documents, okay?”

She let out a big exhale of air. “Okay, okay, sure. I’ll… be in my office if you change your mind, I guess.”

You nodded and picked up your laptop, and Abby did the same, making her way back to her office and settling behind the large, mahogany desk. You returned to your own desk next to Mel’s and sat down. And *of course* your desk had a line of sight directly to Abby’s office. You could see Abby seated at her large mahogany desk, a stern look of concentration on her face as she typed away rapidly behind her laptop.

You turned your head back to your screen, and started working your way through the documents one at a time, making notes and annotations that might prompt requirements for your brief. Every so often, you’d glance up and see Abby’s face deep in thought, that strong jawline tensed and her lower lip pulling between her teeth absent-mindedly from time to time.

Damnit. Her looking so gorgeous was absolutely ***not*** helping things right now. She’d taken off her coat and rolled her shirt up to her elbows, showing off a muscular forearm as her hand moved to rub her forehead, a slightly pained expression across her face.

Your mind was going back and forth about how you’d spoken to her. *Maybe I over-reacted,* you thought, drumming your fingers on the desktop. But then a yawn would escape your mouth, and you knew you’d have many long hours ahead of you before you could finish for the night.

***No, it was completely reasonable for me to react the way I did***, you reassured yourself. ***I need to set boundaries. I don’t need another Johns Hopkins situation on my hands.***

*But she’s so dreamy sitting there in her fancy suit, with those sexy forearms, and that studious look on her gorgeous face…*

*Keep it together,* you reminded yourself. *You’re doing this for the exhibition, and for the future of your art*.

“For the art,” you said, not realising you’d spoken it aloud, and you looked around to make sure Abby hadn’t heard you. Thankfully, she was transfixed on her laptop.

You read in earnest for another couple of hours, highlighting and making comments on the document as you went. You could’ve *sworn* you caught Abby stealing a glance at you once or twice when you looked up, but perhaps that was just wishful thinking.

When your tummy rumbled at 8:42pm, you grabbed a muesli bar and an apple from your satchel, and nibbled at them while you worked. The sun had long since dipped below the horizon, and the world outside was dark, illuminated by twinkling lights across the harbour.

It turned out the three hundred and twenty-seven-page document was significantly padded with references and photos of samples from pathology tests. A few hours later, you finished working through the final appendix and looked at the time on your computer. It was only 11:38pm.

**Hah, only 11:38**, you thought ruefully, with a grimace. Your first day on the contract, and you were finishing up more almost 6 hours late already.

“Well, at least that’s done,” you whispered to yourself, and you flicked your eyes over the shortlist of questions you’d created, typing out a draft email that you could review in the morning with Owen before it was sent to Isaac.

You were packing away your belongings into your satchel when Abby’s office door opened, her eyes moving straight to yours, and you startled.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt you,” she said quietly, and she looked tired. Her suit jacket was draped over her shoulder by one finger, and she held her laptop under her arm with a pile of books against of it.

You let out a massive, irrepressible yawn. “It’s ok, I was heading out anyway,” you responded, blinking to wake your brain up a bit.

Your eyes met hers, and fuck—even with how tired she seemed, those blue eyes looked gorgeous. You just wanted her to pull you into her arms and wrap you up and kiss your forehead. Why had you gotten so worked up earlier? All of your anxiety had faded with exhaustion.

You both walked towards the elevator, and Abby pressed the down button, waiting for you to enter before her when it opened.

Standing next to you in the lift, she glanced at her watch. The lift slowly hummed as it moved, but the silence between the two of you was like a heavy fog.

“I’m… I’m sorry I got… short with you earlier,” you said, hoping she might understand.

“It’s fine,” she said, and she seemed distracted, scrolling through the email app on her phone. She let out a small, tired yawn herself now, as the lift dinged and the doors opened on the lobby.

You both left through the security gate, and walked towards the entrance to the lobby.

“Are you ok to get home?” she asked, her eyes travelling across your face. “You’re not driving back to the mountain tonight, are you?” she added with concern.

“I’ve got my car, and I’m staying at a place in Belmont during the week,” you replied.

“Oh good, that’s good,” she said, sounding reassured, but things between you were still awkward.

She pressed the big exit button to open the lobby doors, letting you exit first before following behind you. She fished her keys from her pocket, and clicked the remote and her Jeep beeped at her from across the parking lot.

You both paused on the sidewalk outside the lobby, looking at each other. It would be so easy to forget about everything you’d been through today, and all the ways it reminded you of the Doctor at Johns Hopkins.

Part of you willed yourself to ask if you could go back to her place. You fidgeted with the car keys in your pocket, eyes moving between your feet and Abby’s face.

*Can I stay at your place? Just say it*, you implored yourself. Or maybe she’d ask if she could stay at yours.

“Well, uh,” she looked at you with that indecipherable look across her face, eyes boring into your own, searching for something, perhaps. “I’ll… see you tomorrow, I guess?”

“Yeah. yep. Ok.” You sighed softly, trying to pretend everything was fine. How had everything been so completely easy last night, and so, so difficult just twenty-four hours later? “See you tomorrow,” you finished, as casually as you could.

“Drive safe,” and she did a cute little farewell wave at you with one hand, before turning to walk towards the Jeep. You watched her walk away, and she briefly looked back at you over her shoulder for just a second before turning back towards her car.

You climbed into Sausage the car, piling your satchel onto the front seat, and programming the address of the Williams’s suburban home into your phone before crossing your arms on the wheel and leaning your head against it sullenly.

“Today really sucked, Sausage” you lamented aloud with a big, forlorn sigh. "Well, first it was mind-blowingly awesome, but *then* it sucked," you corrected yourself.

You watched in the rearview mirror as the taillights of Abby's Jeep pulled out of the parking lot and drove away.

<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>“*Tea* is what’s wrong with tea. You should drink a *real* beverage in the morning,” Abby scoffed, taking a large gulp of coffee, exaggerating her satisfaction as she did so, and looking to the others with an *Am I right, folks?* face. Mel and Owen mumbled in assent.
“I’m with Abby on this one, I’m afraid,” Owen conceded gravely to you, before letting out a small laugh.
“You *consultants* and your *Americanos*,” and you rolled your eyes right back at them, voice sassy and unabashed. “You’re like… a stereotype of *yourselves. Honestly*. No matter, though—*some* of us have a more refined palette, I suppose,” and you took a haughty, self-righteous sip, a smirk appearing at the edge of your lips.

You survived your first day with Abby as your colleague, but there's a long way still to go on your project. Problem is, you can't stop thirsting over Abby, and she can't seem to help flirting with *you*.
Can you two maintain your professional boundaries? And how will you navigate things when past hurts come back to haunt you both?</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>Thanks for your patience, bbs! I just finished up my old job, and am about to start a new one, so it’s been A Time(TM).
This chapter has also been quite challenging to write. It was originally going to be much longer, but I basically did a whole rewrite in the last two days and split it into two chapters so it flows a little better, and to allow the characters room for growth.
If you care about this sort of thing up front: There’s reference to Reader’s childhood friendship with Ellie, including brief mentions of her parents, who are Anna (alive) and Joel (yes, they are magically together, go with it), early on at the start of the chapter. It’s not much in total: just a couple of paragraphs for narrative and worldbuilding purposes, and it’s all pretty light.
Owen and Mel are back, and we meet Manny for the first time!
I hope you get some kind of twisted enjoyment of the consulting worldbuilding—and that it makes you laugh either at or with them all (your choice!). Let’s just say I’ve spent a lot of time in that world, so it’s very familiar to me (and for those of you who know what the fuck this means: I’m very pro-agile, but only when it’s done right—which is rarely, unfortunately!
There’s also a bit of angst towards the end of this chapter, so strap in.
But as a nice treat to get us all through: there's more of Abby Wears A Suit! It’s been delightful piecing together her wardrobe in my mind. Nothing like some sartorial joy to keep a writer going.

</aside>

You got home just before midnight, parking Sausage in the familiar driveway of the Williams’s home where you would stay during the week while working.

You hauled your oversized duffle upstairs, opting against sleeping in the master bedroom. You’d walked in there, taken one look at the umpteen photos of Anna and Joel Williams, Ellie and her wife Dina, and their admittedly *very* cute new addition to the family, baby JJ, and walked straight back out again, closing the door behind you. The idea of sleeping in a room surrounded by photos of your best childhood friend and their family was just too… weird. *What* if you wanted to jerk off? Or bring someone back here? Your mind flashed to Abby before pushing the thought away.

Absolutely not.

You walked along the hall and peeked into Ellie’s old bedroom. The Williamses had clearly left it as a bit of a shrine to Ellie after she went off to college years ago. Ellie’s beaten-up guitar case had been leaning against the end of the bookshelf, covered in various stickers featuring bands, dinosaurs, and now-cringey phrases you two used to say to each other while endlessly listening to music and sketching in your visual journals for art. The bookshelf itself was still crammed full of graphic novels and comics, including her fave, *Savage Starlight*.

Various band posters still hung all over the walls: Pearl Jam, a-ha, and of course, the concert poster you’d stolen from the venue where you’d both gone to see *The Sick Habit* play the week after your high school graduation. You’d smiled on seeing that old poster, heavily faded from a decade of sunshine through her bedroom window, and creased and tattered at the edges from when it had been stowed beneath Ellie’s t-shirt after she’d pilfered it on the way out the concert venue. You snapped a photo with your phone, and texted it to Ellie, adding the caption “*memories* 😭😭❤️” before hitting send.

In the end, you decided to sleep in the guest bedroom across the hall from Ellie’s. As fortune would have it, there was a handwritten note from Anna Williams atop a small pile of bathroom necessities: a towel, hand towel and face washer.

It read: “Welcome back, sweetie. Sorry we couldn’t be here to welcome you, but all going well we will be in the Northern Territory where Joel is hoping to photograph some rare stork (yep—same old Joel, forever in dorky dad mode)! I figured you’d end up in this room, so I made up the bed for you. Make yourself at home. I left strawberry pop tarts on the counter for you.”

You had smiled at this last addition: after all these years, Anna still remembered your favourite breakfast treat.

On reading the note, you’d settled in to the cozy bed. The room has smelled the same as always, and as you closed your eyes, you heard the sound of branches quietly rattling against the window panes, rain now hammering against the glass.

Your alarm went off at 7:15am the next morning and you were in no way ready to get up. Still groggy from the late night at the office. You mashed the snooze button twice in a row, but when 7:35 rolled around, you figured you should probably haul your ass out of bed so you wouldn’t be late for the 9am meeting with the team at FFL&Y. It was weird waking up in an different bed for the third day in a row, and as you blinked your eyes open, you recalled watching Abby drive away the night before, and how empty it had made you feel.

How was it possible that she was now your colleague? Or more importantly, how was it **fair**? And worse, how had she managed to throw you under the bus like that in your very first meeting with Isaac?

Maybe you had taken it too personally. But then, this kind of thing **felt** so personal to you, after what you’d been through at Johns Hopkins.

“Hey, time to focus!” You tried to convince yourself by speaking your thoughts aloud. “Put your feelings for her out of your mind. This year is all about the exhibition. You’re an artist, remember?”

You dragged yourself out of bed and into the shower, hoping you could start the day—and perhaps, things with Abby—anew. Just because you knew you couldn’t date her didn’t mean you weren’t hoping things with the project could be a bit more genial and collaborative from here on.

You arrived at your desk by 8:45am and found a takeaway cup sitting there on the desktop staring at you, steam rising from the lid. You picked it up and inhaled: the scent of a perfectly milky tea wafted through your nostrils, and you sighed in satisfaction at the comforting smell, before being ever so slightly taken aback, knowing who had likely left it there for you.

You looked anxiously around the office, hoping no-one else had seen her put the drink there for you, but there were only a few dweeby looking interns and it looked as though they hadn’t even noticed you standing there. Phew.

You now cast your eyes to the exec offices, and saw Abby reclined in her office chair, faced towards the large bookshelf, phone to her ear and one leg casually crossed atop the other. Her hand rubbed against the back of her neck, causing the sleeve of today’s suit jacket—navy plaid—to strain against the girth of her arm.

Those arms, though. You licked your lips.

*How does she look so goddamned good every time I see her*, you pondered, as your mouth lolled open in awe. She had such an effortlessly put-together way about her, like she’d just rolled out of bed looking oh-so-fine, perpetually comfortable in her skin.

And of course, at precisely that moment, she spun around in her office chair to look at her laptop, and caught you staring right at her.

*Fuck.* You blushed, and attempted a casual wave, and a deliberately-not-overly-friendly smile, raising the warm takeaway cup with gratitude. She paused briefly mid-sentence, before giving you a tiny half-smile, and continued her conversation, eyes still fixed on yours. Your eyes lingered for a moment, a hot sparkle of… well, you didn’t quite know what, passing between the two of you—so you forced yourself to look away, and started setting up your desk.

“Exhibition, exhibition, exhibition,” you muttered robotically to yourself.

“What exhibition?” an smooth, bright voice asked behind you, and it was Owen, cheery disposition on his face, wearing a striped wool sweater and a checked business shirt that most definitely did *not* go together.

“Oh, morning, Owen,” you replied, smiling warmly, a little dazed at being pulled from your Abby-themed reverie. While Owen’s fashion sense left a lot to be desired, he was so friendly and hard not to like—a bit akin to a golden retriever wagging its tail at you.

“I’m… hoping to put on an exhibition sometime this year,” you said, a little timidly, your grimace hinting at the self-confidence you lacked in your ability to bring the whole thing from concept to reality.

“That’s *awesome*!” and he seemed so genuinely impressed that it was actually really nice. Hearing his enthusiasm kindof made it feel real. “What are you going to be exhibiting? Do you draw, or paint, or…?”

“Actually, I do… woodblock prints?” you offered, looking for any sense of familiarity in his eyes, but he looked confused. “Kinda like those traditional Japanese prints you see. Here, I’ll show you,” and you pulled out your phone and he leaned in with curiosity as you began searching your phone for photos of some of your older pieces.

A terse voice cut in behind both of you. “Are you both ready for the 9am?” It was Mel, striding across to her desk looking irritated at both of you, but Owen was too busy emitting a series of ‘*ooohs’* and ‘*whoas’* as you swiped through an album of your prints on your phone.

“Oh, that’s so *amazing*,” he said, when you’d showed him a photo of a half-finished woodblock carving, describing how it would become the thing from which you printed the ink onto the paper to create one layer of colour in the print. He completely ignored Mel.

“So, like, youuuuu create *several* of these, and then line them all up and they make, like, those painting thingies you just showed?” he continued. “That’s *insane*! Mel, you totally have to see this,” he said, gesturing her come and look.

“I *can’t*, Owen, *some* of us want to be ready for the stand-up,” she responded, her tone prickly.

“Sheesh, relax Mel. It’s only 8:54,” and he flashed you a little eye roll that Mel couldn’t see—causing you to bite your lip to repress a smirk—before he enthusiastically carried on the conversation: “Ok ok, you have to show me some more! And how long do those bits of wood take to, like… *cut up*, I guess?”

“To *carve*,” you clarified with a smile, and he nodded, listening keenly to your words, “I mean, it depends on the piece, and the number of layers you’re trying to work with… but each individual woodblock can take between… 5-20 hours?” you mused, eyebrows furrowed reflectively, “and it’ll be used for just one layer of ink.”

“Holy… *what?!?*” and his mind was blown.

You carried on discussing your work while Mel made passive-aggressive huffs in the background while you spoke, and then a few minutes later, Owen announced, “Ok! Time for stand-up!” He noticed your ‘*What the hell is standup?’* face, before clarifying, “Stand-up is just the term we use for our morning team meetings.”

“Oh, sure, I guess,” you shrugged, not really caring what it was called or why. Owen waved in Abby’s direction to get her attention, and gestured for her to join you all.

Abby emerged from her office, coffee in one hand, phone pressed to her ear with the other, a tense look on her face. “Yeah, like I said a minute ago, Doug,” her voice was irritable, “I’ll have it done by the end of the day. But you and Nora need to do something about the competing deadlines you have me on. I literally *can’t* do two things at once. Figure it out, and then tell me which one of you is getting your shit first.” You could hear this Doug’s person’s angry voice on the other end of the phone. “Doug—DOUG,” Abby spoke loudly over him, as if speaking to a toddler. “I’m going now. I’ve got stand-up for Isaac’s thing. Figure it out with *her*, it’s not my problem to fix,” and she hung up, shaking her head in frustration as she joined the three of you gathered around a whiteboard, standing between you and Owen. “Sorry, folks, Doug’s just being… Doug,” and she rolled her eyes, taking a tired sip of her coffee.

Owen grimaced, and even Mel made a knowing look of sympathy. “It’s all good Abby, don’t worry about it,” Owen smiled.

You brought your own cup to your lips, and Abby deliberately sniffed in your direction. “Are you drinking *tea*?” she asked wryly, making a face of mock disgust at you, and taking another big swig from her cup. *You* knew that she’d been the one to buy it for you in the first place—but *she* knew there wasn’t a chance in hell you’d tell the rest of the team about that only for the purpose of rebuffing her teasing remark.

You pouted at her, staring straight into her eyes, willing her to hear your inner monologue as it quipped, *Don’t think I don’t know exactly what you’re doing, Abby*. But instead, you just smiled back at her, the insincerity on your face playfully apparent.

“Tea? Why though?!” Mel snorted, looking at you in a show of overly-dramatic distaste, while Owen smirked in response to her words.

“Hey, what’s wrong with *tea*?” you pouted defensively.

“*Tea* is what’s wrong with tea. You should drink a *real* beverage in the morning,” Abby scoffed, taking a large gulp of coffee, exaggerating her satisfaction as she did so, and looking to the others with an *Am I right, folks?* face. Mel and Owen mumbled in assent.

“I’m with Abby on this one, I’m afraid,” Owen conceded gravely to you, before letting out a small laugh.

“You *consultants* and your *Americanos*,” and you rolled your eyes right back at them, voice sassy and unabashed. “You’re like… a stereotype of *yourselves. Honestly*. No matter, though—*some* of us have a more refined palette, I suppose,” and you took a haughty, self-righteous sip, a smirk appearing at the edge of your lips.

They all chimed in at once, teasing you with ‘*Whatever’* and ‘*Pfft, sure’* before you all laughed. It was nice to laugh with them, and feel a little like part of the team for first time.

“Ok, ok—shall we get started?” Owen asked all of you, a broad grin across his face, and happy nods ensued all round. Owen grabbed a marker and began drawing stuff up on the whiteboard.

As he did so, Abby crossed her arms, bringing her coffee cup back up to her sublimely pouty lips. She was smirking, delighted by her own superior wit, you supposed. Her eyes looked sideways at you and caught your own, and she cocked that eyebrow of hers smugly in your direction.

The last time you’d seen her do this was the previous morning—when her face had been looking up at you from between your thighs.

*Not NOW*\*\*,\*\* you told yourself, gulping the thought down visibly, which caused Abby’s plush lips to curl deliciously again. Satisfied she’d had the desired effect on you, she turned back towards Owen, who had started writing a list of tasks on the whiteboard.

*How the hell am I gonna get through this project when she’s making those faces at every opportunity?* You took a big inhale, resigning yourself to what you supposed was going to be a challenging few months. *Exhibition, exhibition, exhibition,* you repeated in your mind.

The four of you planned out the week’s work, and then got stuck in to your various tasks. The day passed smoothly enough. You’d worked with Owen for some of the morning to produce a list of the various brand elements you’d need to get done throughout the project—logo, accessible colour palette, typefaces, and document templates—and what meetings would be required with Isaac along the way to get things approved.

The timelines were tight, but you could make it work, and Owen said he’d help support you to by setting expectations with Isaac around timely feedback and approvals, to help minimise delays and manage any risks.

The office was much busier now, most of the desks filled up with besuited consultants on calls or mashing away at their keyboards, using corporate bullshit like *‘let’s touch base’, ‘I just want to circle back’,* and *‘If I’m to play devil’s advocate, here…’*.

The cringe was real. You definitely *hadn’t* missed the douchiness of consulting firms.

Abby left the office mid-afternoon, laptop under her arm and jacked draped over her shoulder with one finger. She exuded a casual coolness that you couldn’t help but gaze at—and nor could several of your colleagues, it seemed.

She had a commanding presence about her; a confidence in her step that was indescribably magnetic. A couple of the people made a collegiate wave in her direction as she strolled past, but they went unnoticed. Abby wore the same, serious expression you’d seen on her face this morning before she’d noticed you. It wasn’t snobbiness, but more like she was intensely focused on her work, or trying to juggle a lot.

As she walked from her office towards the elevators, Abby strutted past your desk, and based on what you could hear, was on another tense-sounding phone call. In spite of this, she gave you the tiniest wink when she noticed you looking up at her, and you flushed immediately and forced your eyes back to your laptop as earnestly as you could, hoping no-one had noticed the exchange.

Despite your best efforts, however, Mel gave you a side-eyed glance, curiosity in her furrowed brows as she looked from you to Abby and back again—and so, you became intensely focussed on the document on your screen all of a sudden.

The end of the day arrived, thankfully less stressful than the previous one. While you packed your things away, you couldn’t help staring at the large, empty chair in Abby’s office, and a small pang of longing swelled in your chest.

On Wednesday morning, you arrived early at your desk to find another cup of tea waiting for you. This morning, Abby *did* notice your arrival, and simply looked over her laptop at you with that indecipherable expression.

You looked down at the steaming cup of tea in your hands, and then back at Abby, eyebrows raised in a look that said, *‘So this is going to happen every day then?’*

She merely shrugged her shoulders at you like she had no idea what you were talking about.

You shook your head in resignation, and allowed a tiny smirk to cross your lips. *This is just tea*, you reassured yourself, *You set boundaries with her. She’s just being friendly, and for the sake of your contract, you can’t allow anything to happen anyway. Accepting a cup of tea doesn’t mean anything more will happen.*

“Yep, that’s right, nothing’s gonna to happen,” you sighed, hating the reality of saying it out loud. Abby was now in deep focus behind her laptop screen and making a sexy concentrating face. If you were honest, you found *all* her expressions sexy at this point. Your head lolled to the side as you stared at her.

“What’s not going to happen?” Mel asked from behind you, and you startled.

“Huh? What? Nothing!” you responded, thoroughly awkwardly as you whipped around to face Mel. Had you really said that aloud?! “I was just, uh—how are… you this morning, Mel?” you redirected, completely suspiciously.

Mell narrowed her eyes at you, and then glanced over your shoulder in Abby’s direction before replying. “I’m fine thanks,” and she seemed in a slightly better mood this morning. “What’s on the cards for you today?”

“Logos, logos, and more logos,” you responded, looking resigned to your fate. The email you’d been sent about the branding had been so vague that you barely had any guidance on where to start. “Isaac’s brief mentioned words like ‘dynamic’, ‘powerful’, and ‘techy’,” you said, making air-quotes, “but he didn’t send any example brands as I requested, and nothing on colour or typeface, either.” You sighed.

All he’d given you was the company name he’d decided upon: Lykos Diagnostics—’lykos’ being Greek for ‘wolf’, and ‘wolf’ being extrapolated from the WLF acronym of Washington Liberty Financial. It was tenuous, but certainly not the *worst* business name you’d had to brand, so you were fine with it. But without a steer on the visual direction from him, you were gonna have to come up with concepts that had some kind of story behind them to make a egocentric ass like Isaac feel important and clever.

You’d worked with clients like him before, and it was usually just a matter of having three options: a concept that was good, a concept that was amazing but probably a bit too risqué for their tastes, and a third throw-away option that was fine but unexciting, and existed solely to make the other two concepts appear more desirable.

“Anyway, yeah, that’s my focus for today,” you continued, “coming up with as many ideas as possible to show you all tomorrow so we can whittle it down to a short list. I want to be ready for the first brand review with Isaac next week.”

“Oh, yikes, I don’t envy you *that* task,” Mel said, gritting her teeth empathetically, as she started unpacking her laptop and various bits and pieces from her bag.

“Thanks for the encouragement,” you chuckled sarcastically, taking a bracing sip from your cup of tea. She immediately laughed along with you.

“No, no, I didn’t mean it like *that*,” she smirked apologetically, ”I’m sure you’ll come up with something *great*. Hot tip, though? Isaac ***hates*** the colour blue. He said something about it being ‘overused in the med tech industry’ when Nora and I were on the phone with him last week,” she offered helpfully.

“Oh—thanks for the heads up. That’s really helpful, actually,” and you meant it. You’d take any guidance you could get at this point.

“Sure thing. My day’s full of the market risk assessment work, which is about as thrilling as it sounds,” you both laughed, and you were glad Mel seemed to be warming to you, “but if you want to show me through any ideas later today, just ask. I should be around,” and she smiled.

Just then, Owen appeared, today’s sweater that featured yet another truly horrific colour palette: khaki, pale blue, yellow and orange. “Standuuuuup!” he called enthusiastically, and waving jazz hands at you both, and then at Abby who was still in her office. Mel sighed, and you snorted with repressed laughter before coming to join him at the whiteboard.

A few hours later, you stood up from your laptop to stretch your legs, having made a decent start on the logo concepts. You wanted to take a break from working between your iPad and laptop to rest your eyes, and so you rifled through your bag for your sketchbook.

*Damn, must have left it on the counter*, you mused, after scouring all the compartments of your bag hopefully for the second time. Owen suggested you could find blank paper in the print room, which was was down the hallway that ran between the two big meeting rooms, and round the corner.

You could see boxes of copy paper piled high as you approached from the hallway, but you were immediately taken aback when you entered the room to see Abby leaning casually against the copier, typing away on her phone while large quantities of paper spat out of the printer behind her.

Without moving, she looked up at you from beneath raised eyebrows. “Hey,” she said coolly, the tiniest hint of a smirk at the corner of her mouth.

You did a double-take. Abby hadn’t been at standup this morning, and so you hadn’t seen her around the office yet—which was probably lucky, as she looked so damned fine you could just about drool.

She was wearing a grey plaid suit, and beneath it, a pristine white business shirt in a herringbone fabric with a skinny blue necktie. Every detail was perfect: cuffs peeking just so from below the jacket sleeves, pants precisely cut to show off her well-sculpted thighs and butt. Even her shoes—a pair of wingtip brogues in a rich, brown leather—were immaculately buffed. The finishing touch was the white linen pocket square with blue piping, arranged with artful dishevelment in the top pocket of her jacket.

You drew a sharp intake of breath as you took in the sight of her, while she merely looked back at you, a cocky smoulder in her eyes.

*A fucking necktie?!! It should be illegal for her to wear that,* you thought, pressing your lips together, before dragging your teeth against your lower lip.

She looked like a total snack.

“Fuck,” you panted, and she snickered—making you realise that, for the second time today, you’d spoken your internal monologue aloud. “I mean—I didn’t mean—oh, *fuck*,” and you slapped a hand to your forehead, a pained expression on your face.

You were utterly mortified.

And all the while, Abby chortled silently at how flustered she was making you.

“Are you… okay?” she snickered, barely containing her glee.

“I don’t *think* so, *no*,” and your eyebrows drooped in a sort of hopeless pine, and you both laughed. “I mean, fuck, Abby, it’s not fair of you to be wearing—” and you gestured wildly in her direction with your hands, “—*this,”* you finished, a small whine to your voice as you said it.

“What, *clothes*?” she smirked, evidently pleased with her witty retort. “Should I… not be wearing them?” and those eyes burned suggestively at you.

“You *know* what I mean,” you bit back, chastising her, “and… and the tea every morning?”

“You don’t like the tea?” she cut in.

“You *know* I like the tea, *as well*,” you snipped, and you really were trying to be serious, but she looked so good that it was definitely coming across as flirty.

“Uh, I’m sorry, I guess?” but there was no way she actually meant it. “I can stop bringing you tea, if you want?” she offered, bemused.

“No, I don’t mean—” and you looked at the ceiling and let out a long sigh, “Abby, it’s just—do you have to make this so hard?” you pleaded, and as you spoke, the printer continued whirring, spitting out copy after copy. “I mean, it’s been three days since we had,” you glanced around, making sure there was no one coming up the hall, and lowered your voice, “since we had *completely* mind-blowing sex, and, and… it’s just, the *tea*; and the *look* you were giving me in standup yesterday; and that *suit*, well—you *know* how good you look in that suit,” you blustered, giving her an accusatory look.

Abby responded with a playful shrug as if to say, ‘*It can’t be helped’*, and you huffed in exasperation.

“Abby. You’re making it extremely difficult for me to *not* want to jump you,” and you were being serious, but jesus fucking christ you were *so turned on* right now. She was confident, and charming, and cocky, and it was *oh* so inviting.

She moved from her casual lean against the copier, put her hands in her pockets—which somehow made her look even *more* casually alluring—and she began walking slowly towards you.

“I mean—” she spoke in a low voice, “you could always just… *not* not jump me…” she offered, eyes smouldering at you, another playful shrug.

*Fuck, was it hot in here?* “Abby, of course I *want* to…” and you gulped at lust in her eyes as she walked slowly towards you. The tiny part of you willing yourself not to give in to your feelings was being eclipsed by the heat flooding your body, and the sensation thrumming between your thighs.

You tried to respond, but your voice faltered. “Abby, we—I…” You could smell that woody pine smell that seemed to follow her around as her body crept closer towards yours.

“Yeah?” she said, her voice breathy and soft, and she was barely a foot away from you now.

*Goddammit, please just kiss me,* your brain was pleading.

“We probably shouldn’t…” but your hand reached out towards her, fingers grabbing the base of her necktie with a gentle tug.

And then, all of a sudden—several things happened at once.

“Heyyyyy, chica!” a loud voice echoed down the hallway, accompanied by fast-paced footsteps, “have you got the contracts for that pandejo, Douglas—” and he stopped mid-sentence when he reached the doorway.

You startled, stepping back from Abby with your hands raised by your sides, your foot catching a bundle of toner cartridges leaning precariously against the counter.

At the same time, Abby’s hand sailed over your shoulder, reaching for something.

*Oh god oh god oh god!*

“Oh—hey,” the man said, eyes darting to you as he took in the scene before him, and then to at Abby, whose face was now even closer to yours, her arm now over your right shoulder. A suspicious smirk began to form on his face and he raised his eyebrows.

“Oh, no, I was just grabbing—” she chucked innocently, pulling back her arm and flourishing a stapler she’d picked up from the shelf behind your head, “—stapler,” and she smiled, looking from him to you with a broad smile. and then she waggled the stapler at Manny. “Got so many of these damned things to send out,” and she gestured over her shoulder at the neat stacks of paper on the printer. “Oh, Manny, have you met our new designer yet?” she continued smoothly, head jerking in your direction.

“Uhhhh, no, I haven’t,” he replied, generously allowing the ruse to play out—even though *you* knew that *she* knew that *he* knew *exactly* what had been going on before he entered the room. He smirked again, leaning towards you with an outstretched hand. “Hey, Manny. Good to meet you. Nora told me all about you.”

He wore a dark grey wool suit, his pristine white business shirt open at the collar, and a chunky silver chain visible at his décolletage. As he reached his hand towards you, you could smell bergamot and spice, and noticed shiny silver tennis racquet cufflinks peeking out from below the sleeves of his jacket.

“Nice to meet you, too,” you swallowed, shaking his hand and forcing yourself to smile as best you could. “Your office is next to Abby’s right? With all the photography equipment?” You hoped you were doing a convincing job of acting like everything was juuuust fiiiiine, because internally, your heart was pounding in your throat.

“Oh, yeah. You a photographer as well?” he asked, stepping back. Behind you, Abby turned to picked up the paper from the printer, and began stapling each of the collated bundles.

“Not seriously, but I have a good friend who is. Plus, you know—designers like pictures,” you shrugged with a smile.

“Yeah, makes sense,” he nodded. “I’m so sorry to be rude, but—” he looked at you apologetically and grimaced, before he turned to Abby. “Are you right to get the contracts out by courier by 1 o’clock? Doug’s in one of his *moods* again, and I reckon he’ll have a coronary if the clients’ lawyers don’t get these today,” he said, rolling his eyes.

“Yeah, of course, no sweat,” she nodded reassuringly.

“Nice, thanks. Better dash, gotta run to the Dade Capital meeting. Gym later?” he quizzed her, halfway out the door already.

“Nah, can’t today,” she replied, “tomorrow?”

“Fine by me. That means I can catch up with that ecologist from the second floor,” he waggled his eyebrows at Abby, who shook her head in disbelief, “I’ll text you. Nice to meet you,” and he flicked a little two-figured farewell salute at her and then at you, and swaggered off, the sound of his footsteps disappearing up the hallway.

When you could no longer hear him, you leaned against a wall, your head falling back as you raised your eyes to the ceiling, thanking your lucky stars he hadn’t walked in a moment later. You let out a big exhale.

Abby added the final document she’d just stapled to the pile she’d made, and moved towards you.

“You okay?” she asked, and she grinned at you, eyebrows raised with playful concern.

“Jesus. Fuck, Abby. That was too close,” you gulped, tapping your balled fists against your thighs. “I really thought—” and your brow furrowed anxiously.

“It’s *fine*. Really. It was just Manny,” she reassured you in a soothing voice, “there’s no way in hell he’d say anything—even if he *had* seen something. Do you know how many times I’ve seen him literally *having sex* in the office after hours? One time was too many, but I swear to god, it’s been a *lot* more than once,” and she closed her eyes and shook her head in disgust. You tried to laugh, but your anxiety was still weighing heavily.

Abby brought her large hands to rest upon either side of your waist and brushed gently against you the fabric there with her thumbs. You closed your eyes, and pulled your lower lip between your teeth. The feel of her hands on you assuaged your anxiety somewhat. Her touch felt so *normal*; so *right*.

You moved your hands to her chest just below her collarbone, rubbing your fingertips in tiny motions back and forth against her shirt. Abby surveyed you, but you were avoiding her gaze. Your hearing felt magnified times a thousand, your ears pricked and ready to detect the slightest noise coming from beyond the room. Your heart thudded uncomfortably in your throat.

You *really did want* to give in to your feelings for Abby. It would be so easy to just fall into whatever this was, and feel good for a little while at least.

When you were in your twenties, your internalised self-loathing had really done a number on you, and it had taken very little for you to to say, “*To hell with the consequences, have fun now, and figure out the rest later*.” It sure as hell made for some entertaining stories, and the kind of emotional yearning and chaos that made you feel alive back then.

But the flip-side had been a lot of heartache: lovers who just wanted to party, and avoided emotional intimacy at all costs, or weren’t there for you when you really needed them. You’d tried to be cool with it all, but in the end, you’d been burned too many times, and completely withdrew. The older you got, the harder it was to bounce back.

After a lot of therapy, and learning what mattered to you and how to advocate for that, you were ready for a Real, Proper RelationshipTM with a grown-up adult who had not only emotional intelligence and a secure job, but an actual career *and* a plan for the future. You cared about where your life was going, and you wanted someone to plan the future with, rather than just flit endlessly from partner to partner without either of you ever really growing.

And then came The Doctor.

The Doctor had made you feel like the centre of the universe when you’d first met—*'love bombing'*, your therapist had called it, after everything went to shit. As it turned out, there’s was a fine line between someone who was attentive to your needs, and someone who was selling you a reality they had no intention or ability to following through with.

She’d told you that you were unlike anyone she’d ever met; that your ‘creative spirit’ was what she’d had been looking for in the drab, conservative world of medicine that was all about competition and career progression; that she loved your obsession with nature and being amongst the trees; that it didn’t matter you didn’t have a high profile job or a mortgage or a fancy car; these were all things that she *loved* about you, and made you more ‘real’.

And at the start, things *had* been good: she’d come with you on hiking trips, and accompanied you to tiny art galleries when you’d wanted to see the work of obscure printmakers she’d never heard of. There were dinners at interesting restaurants with long conversations about what you each wanted for the future, and a key to their architecturally-designed but not-too-ostentatious three-storey terrace. She’d talked about how she wanted to make a career change—to go work for a non-profit, saying things like, “I’m fucking done with this corporate medicine bullshit, I want to help *real* people”. It was a nice dream to inhabit: this sexy, capable, driven doctor who had a clear path towards what they wanted from their life, and who wanted you to be part of it.

After a while, though, it was like the novelty of you had worn off, and you didn’t understand why. You were no longer the exciting new thing to impress, or enough of a disruption to the tedium of their life. What you were left with, time after time, were broken promises and blame-games: about why she couldn’t make time for a day hike in the next month—but there was miraculously time to attend several last-minute work functions; that you needed to stop complaining about your paid job, and actually commit to your art—but that her venting was *completely* different, because she could only go work for Médecins Sans Frontières *after* her next promotion; that you were selfish for spending time outside your paid job to hone your woodworking skills rather than spending time with her—but playing golf with her boss was somehow critical to *her* career trajectory, and she couldn’t get out of it.

The final straw *should have* been when, on the night of your first big opening, she just didn’t show up for you. It was a showcase of printmakers under thirty-five who were keeping traditional woodblock printing alive, and it was the first time one of your works was going to be at an exhibition alongside a dozen or so established printmakers. You had to travel interstate for it, and you were so nervous, certain that people would ignore your work as amateurish next to so many of the modern greats.

You had waited and waited at the airport for her to arrive. And then a text just before your flight boarded: *“The Director of Cardio asked me if I wanted to scrub in on a case for a high-profile patient. Too big an opportunity. I’m soooo sorry!!! You’ll do great though. I’ll make it up to you I promise xx”.*

But no, in reality, the final straw had come when the project you’d been hired for went to hell in a hand basket. After a successful first contract with the hospital, you were asked to support a research program with The Doctor and her team of research fellows. The illustrations you’d produced about the team’s big research study had been published with data that misrepresented the findings—data that The Doctor screwed up. You’d insisted to her that she review *everything* before it went to print, which she said she’d done—but when some researcher from an ivy league university found errors and suggested it called into question the validity of the entire multi-million dollar research program, she had summarily pointed the finger at you. That you had changed the numbers after she’d proofed them, or some other bullshit. And that’s how you’d been fired. It had been humiliating.

What had *really* broken you, however, was when she expected everything to be fine after she’d done this. *“It’s not like this is your career, anyway,”* she’d said dismissively, *“this means you can go off and do your painting things full time anyway—think of it as your big push.”*

To her, your reputation in your \*paid job—\*your \*livelihood—\*meant nothing, as long as *her* career was okay; that she was somehow doing you a big favour. And when you told her what she did wasn’t okay, her response had been that you didn’t understand, and it was *different* in the world of medicine.

Then the next day, she’d dropped over a box of your things outside the front door your apartment with a passive-aggressive note that had said something like, *“Love isn’t meant to be this hard. Hit me up if you ever deal with your control issues.”*

You’d wanted to scream at the indignity of it all.

You’d cried on and off for about three days, and spent an hour a week in therapy for the next two months trying to rebuild your self-esteem and find the wherewithal to secure a new contract.

It had taken so long to shake all you’d endured, personally *and* professionally, from what went down with The Doctor. You just knew for certain you didn’t want to rush into anything like that again, and especially not in the form of an office romance. The risks were too great, and you didn’t want to return to that dark place again.

And it was these thought swimming around your mind that made it hard for you to meet Abby’s eyes.

Abby tucked a strand of hair behind your ear and tilted your chin up with her thumb.

“Hey. It’s *fine*—*really*,” she reiterated, seeking to reassure you, and you *thought* she meant it, but how could you *really* be sure? Because hadn’t the doctor said something like this before, too?

You closed your eyes and pressed your lips together, seeking the courage to say what you didn’t want to say.

“Yeah… this time it was fine, Abby,” and you spoke so quietly, and drew in another deep breath. “It’s just…when I’m with you it all feels so easy, like I could fall into you. Even just the physical stuff, it’s intoxicating.” Abby nodded in agreement. The silence hung between you both for a moment.

“But…” you let out another long sigh. Your heart was pounding, and you felt sick to your stomach.

You tried to speak calmly, clearly, as you said what you needed to say, though you hated to say it.

“Abby—I can’t *do* this. Not while we’re working together, and on the same project, no less. I can’t lose this job. I’ve… been through this before. When things get messy, it won’t be you taking the fall,” and as you said it, you tapped the flat of your palms against her chest and pressed your lips together again, steeling yourself against the part of you that wanted to give in to how much you wanted her, and how good it felt being with her, to just let her kiss you and melt into her strong arms, her soft lips, and those hands—steady, sure, infinitely capable.

She pulled away from you a little, brows creased and serious, and you thought you sensed frustration in her tone. “What do you mean… ‘*when* things get messy’? You say it like it’s predestined. That’s…” she shook her head incredulously, and blinked a few times. “That’s completely ridiculous. We barely even *know* one another—and you’re already assuming how I’d react in some… some imaginary work situation? Why does this need to be so serious, anyway? You’re making this into something it’s not.”

Your mouth fell open in shock, and you looked at her like her words had burned you. You were stunned that she’d be so dismissive of you, so defensive. She’d completely minimised your feelings, and your needs. Just like The Doctor had.

You spoke your next words deliberately, with an intensity that surprised you as the words left your mouth.

“Don’t. Call me. Ridiculous.” You pressed Abby’s body away from you, annoyed.

Your blood was boiling, your emotions running hot in response to the the way she’d twisted your words and erased your experience. You’d tried to be reasonable, you were just setting boundaries, and now she was behaving like… like an emotionally immature asshole.

“You don’t know what I’ve *been* through. I *need* this job,” you said, your voice harsh now. “I don’t have some kind of… fancy cabin in the woods, or some big old trust fund to fall back on,” you spat back at her, your lip curled in distaste and your stomach wrenching. But you regretted the words immediately, even if it what you said was true. You knew it was out of line and wished you could cram the words back in your mouth.

Abby’s expression changed. She looked hurt, or offended, or both. She stepped back, palms raised defensively, and she turned away from you as if trying to figure out what to say in response. Her jaw clenched, and she swallowed, seemingly trying to choke down her emotions.

She turned to face you again, and you realised her hands were shaking. “I’m *sorry* I called you ridiculous, it was a shitty thing to say,” she seethed, taking a massive breath to steady her voice, “but I got that ‘fancy cabin’ and that ‘big old trust fund’ because my dad fucking died,” and the look on her face was so pained as she said it.

Abby closed her eyes and turned away from you again, taking another deep breath, and you thought you saw a tear escape from the corner of her left eye.

“You know what, forget this,” she said bitterly, turning to you again, and her blue eyes were devoid of warmth as they pierced into your own. “I don’t need your judgement, or your drama.”

Shaking her head in disbelief, she grabbed the pile of documents from the printer, and stormed out of the room, her heavy footfalls echoing up the hallway.

You looked around the room, trying to understand what the hell just happened, and how things had escalated like this.

“Fuck. *Goddammit*,” you muttered under your breath, your eyes stinging.

You sank back against the wall, and turned your eyes to the ceiling.

<h3>Chapter End Notes</h3>
<p>Writing this chapter really pulled on my feels. Our poor bb queers and their trauma. Send them hugs. Don’t worry, it will get better real soon.
Half of the next chapter is already written, so hopefully it doesn’t take too long. Building things up again is so much easier and more enjoyable than writing conflict, so send me your goodest vibes of encouragement!
Comments are really welcome as always, they really help a writer like me get those sweet serotonin hits, so: say hi and share your thoughts!
And a bonus fact for you all—'the art of dishevelment' is an Italian concept, called 'sprezzatura' (sprez·za·tu·ra), defined as:
studied nonchalance; graceful conduct or performance without apparent effort (courtesy of Merriam-Webster). Sums up our girl pretty well, I reckon.</p>

<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>“Met someone out hiking actually,” you said, trying to keep your response vague.
“Who??? What are the odds of that?!”
You didn’t respond straight away, and then three dots appeared as Ellie started typing again.
“YOU FUCKING DIDN’T. NO FUCKING WAY WTAF OMGGGGGG!!! 🤣🤣🤣”
What the fuck? There was no way Ellie would be on texting terms with Abby, right?
“DUUUUUUDE DID YOU FUCK ABBY THE LUMBERJACK OMG LOLOLOLOLLLLL?!!!!!!”
--
In the wake of your heated argument with Abby, you're struggling to make sense of how things went so horribly wrong.
Your friend Dina offers a welcome ear and suggests a way forward, while her pain-in-the-ass wife, your best friend Ellie, provides unending comic relief.
But Abby's not the only one who's pissed with you.
What can you possibly do to make things right with Abby?</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>So this chapter didn't go where I expected it to, but it turned out pretty fun. Enter obnoxious Ellie and her actually helpful wife Dina! There's some healthy and entertaining shit-stirring, a little of Reader, but mostly Ellie, who lives up to her reputation as a perpetual troll and well-deserved (emotional!) punching bag. No Ellie hate here, I just think she's a total pain in the arse, and Dina wouldn't have a bar of it!
Manny also makes an appearance to offer both scolding and counsel.
We're working through the feels here, people! There should be enough comic relief in there to get you through! I really enjoyed writing Dina and Reader thirsting over Abby together—I hope you love it too!
As always, comments are welcome and encouraged!</p>

You spent the rest of the afternoon feeling completely shitty for what you’d said to Abby. When you returned from the print room with a pile of blank paper, Abby was nowhere to be seen. Her office was empty, and her laptop and the pile of documents she’d been printing were gone. You swallowed, but the painful, guilty lump in your throat wouldn’t abate.

“You… looking for something?” You heard Mel’s voice through your brain-fog.

“Hmm?” you turned from looking vacantly at Abby’s office towards Mel, who was eyeing you curiously again. “Oh, yeah, I just… you know what, it doesn’t matter.”

“Are you sure? We can go grab a coffee if you want… or a tea, I guess?” she smiled kindly, and you knew she was making an effort—but the word ‘tea’ felt like a stab to your heart. You swallowed again, and your chest ached

“Thanks Mel, I think I just want to get through some sketches,” you replied, aware of how pathetic and forlorn you probably sounded just now. “I mean it, though—thank you,” you added, and gave her a weak smile.

“Sure, well… let me know if you change your mind,” and she smiled supportively before turning back to her work.

You tried to concentrate on sketching concepts for the branding, but your brain was fixed on playing through every detail of what had gone down with Abby. In amongst your guilt, you weren’t entirely clear if you were allowed to be pissed at Abby for the way she’d disregarded your needs, and this was further complicated by the reality that what you’d said to her subsequently was completely shitty.

*What I said was right. She has no idea how hard it is for someone in my position.*

*But how I said it was so shitty.*

*But you couldn’t have known she’d react that way.*

*Yes you could have. Her dad freaking died.*

*Did I make a big deal out of all of this? Should I have just kissed her?*

*Absolutely not. It could’ve been The Doctor all over again.*

*But now I have to work with her for the rest of the project and she probably hates me.*

*Just act professional.*

*Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.*

You felt creatively constipated, and by the time 5pm rolled around, you stared despondently at the pile of crappy sketches before you. Everything you’d drawn looked stupid or boring or reminded you of some other brand that already existed, and you’d probably have to work late one day this week to get through everything in time for the brand presentation next week.

For the time being, however, you felt mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted, and determined it was probably best to pack up and head home for the day, and try and start fresh tomorrow.

As you stepped out of the elevator, you’d decided the best way to deal with your feels was to grab a pizza and a six-pack on the way home so you could collapse on the sofa and rewatch the first season of A League of Their Own to drown your sorrows.

*Yeah a bit of historical queer repression, that’ll be completely uplifting and therapist-approved,* you chastised yourself, resolving that you’d probably watch it anyway.

Your low mood was interrupted by a voice calling out to you as you walked through the foyer.

“Hey *you*!” Jordan called affectionately from behind the front desk, where they were packing up for the day. “How’s was your day?”

You’d been chatting with Jordan through the week whenever you’d passed them in the lobby, or on the occasional visit they made to your floor on an errand for the execs.

You walked towards the information desk, and you must have looked as crappy as you felt, because they made a face of shock. “Oh, are you *ok*? You look *terrible.* I mean, no offence honey, but—it’s true.” They made a sympathetic wince.

“Today sucks,” you sulked miserably. You wanted to blob into a puddle on the info desk counter.

“Awww, what happened? Do I need to put salt in Isaac’s coffee instead of sugar next time he comes in for a meeting? It wouldn’t be the first time,” and they made a conspiratorial face at you.

This elicited a weak chuckle from you, at least. “No, no, I just…” and you exhaled a big breath, “I can’t talk about it yet, I don’t think.”

“I understand. But I’m here if you need someone to listen, okay?” You nodded sadly. “Anything I can I do anything to help?” they asked, and just *that*—just them *asking*, and giving you the sense you weren’t all alone in this—meant the world to you.

“Thanks for offering, but I’ll be ok.” They gave you a kindly scolding look. “Really, I will. I just need to be an amorphous blob on the couch tonight,” and you smiled as best you could, before an idea crossed your mind. “Actually…” you scrunched up your face, a hopeful look in your eyes, “any chance you’re free for pizza and trashy TV tonight?”

“Ooh, I’m so sorry, hun, as amazing as that sounds—I have dinner tonight with my boyfriend’s family,” they rolled their eyes apologetically. “Trust me, I’d much rather have hangs with you than hear my possible future mother-in-law talk about my boyfriend’s sister’s wedding plans for the seventeenth time,” they said through gritted teeth, and you made a small chuckle.

“That’s ok, I shall resign myself to my fate, alone on the sofa,” you said dramatically, pressing the back of your hand to your forehead.

“Oh, hey, what about—I normally do a yoga class before work on Thursdays in the gym on level 1. It’s 7:30–8:00, and they have *really* bougie showers and change facilities for after. You should come tomorrow,” and they looked at you encouragingly.

You were hesitant. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea. I’m like, *really* not flexible. I’ll probably get stuck like a tangled pretzel and they’ll have to cart me off on a stretcher or something.”

“Pfft! Don’t worry about it. It’s a really chill class. Owen comes sometimes, and even *he* manages okay. You can’t be worse at yoga than Owen, can you?”

You raised an eyebrow. “Wanna bet?”

“Well how about this: the instructor Felipé is a friend of mine. I promise he won’t care if you just sit in the back and the best you manage is some deep breathing. I’ll text him tonight and let him know you’re coming so he’ll take it easy on you.” They hauled their tote over their shoulder and started walking with you to the exit of the lobby.

You could hear your therapist’s voice in your head saying, “*Movement is good for mental wellbeing,”* and you groaned, deciding that it probably wasn’t the worst idea right now, and at least you wouldn’t be doing it alone.

“Ok, ok, ok,” you sighed in defeat, “I’ll come on one condition: I can wear my most comfortable, ugly sweatpants. I refuse to wear spandex activewear on principle. And besides—I don’t own any,” you finished, haughty.

“They sounds like a fashion travesty, but for *you*, hun—I’ll let it slide. But those sweats better be *so* bad it’s good,” Jordan said seriously. “Anyway—they sure as hell can’t be any worse than the funky short shorts that Doug from the Client team wears,” they finished in a low voice, a disturbed look in their eyes. “I can never unsee.”

You laughed at that. “Thanks, Jordan. Really. I hate these kinds of things, but… it’s probably good for me,” and you rolled your eyes dramatically.

“Don’t sweat it, sweetie. See you tomorrow morning,” and they gave you a friendly wink and waved little farewell to you as you each went your separate way.

You grabbed a barbecue chicken pizza from a place round the corner from the Williams’s house, and a six-pack of whatever was on special from the convenience store next door, and within thirty minutes of leaving the office, you were curled up on the big comfy sofa, pizza slice in hand and trying to figure out what to watch.

You settled on a trashy reality show, and had worked your way through about half a pizza, but your brain wouldn’t relent, and kept running through everything that had happened with Abby earlier. After two beers and an hour or so of mental back-and-forth, you were interrupted by a buzz on your phone.

It was a text from Ellie in response to the photo of The Sick Habit poster you’d sent her the previous evening.

”Lollllllll that night was so epic. Dina just put on the record from that tour. Do you remember how mad my dad got when he found out weeks later we drank the last of his bourbon?”

You scoffed at the injustice of her recall, and typed out a reply.

“We?!! You barely even let me have a sip, you complete turd. I can’t believe you only got grounded for two weeks, while my mom grounded me for four and I didn’t even get *buzzed*,” you whined in response.

“Hah. Yeah, that was hilarious, actually,” and then two seconds later, Ellie texted you again: “Wait. WAIT. WAITTTTTTT!!!!! Didn’t Leah make out with you that night and then pretend it didn’t happen?!”

“OMGGGGG I completely forgot about that 😅 ughhhh she was so awkward after that night. Ended up asking out that Danny Dinkins douchebag the next day.”

“hahahah yeah you were so bad at kissing that she had to have Dinkins as a palette cleanser lolololollllll 😅”

Fucking Ellie. Always so pleased with her own jokes.

“Screw you. I’ll have you know I received extremely an enthusiastic review merely 3 nights ago,” and as you defended yourself, your mind flashed back to the image of your teeth drawing Abby’s perfectly soft lips into your mouth. A hot spark of desire pulsed within your core, and your mouth watered at the thought of her, before you realised what you were thinking and tried to push the memory of kissing her from your mind.

“WHO?!?!?! Didn’t you only get into Boston on Sunday?! Straight out of the gates. Way to go, champ! 😏” A rare moment of solidarity from Ellie. You were *genuinely* surprised.

“Nah went straight to the cabin.”

“What?! Where the fuck did you meet someone out that way? App or something?” She was prying for gossip that she could use against you later. Such an ass.

“Met someone out hiking actually,” you said, trying to keep your response vague.

“Who??? What are the odds of that?!”

You didn’t respond straight away, and then three dots appeared as Ellie started typing again.

“YOU FUCKING DIDN’T. NO FUCKING WAY WTAF OMGGGGGG!!! 🤣🤣🤣”

What the fuck? There was no way Ellie would be on texting terms with Abby, right?

“DUUUUUUDE DID YOU FUCK ABBY THE LUMBERJACK OMG LOLOLOLOLLLLL?!!!!!!”

*Jesus fucking christ*, you thought, groaning. *How the fuck did she figure out it was Abby?!* Somehow, this felt like the kind of thing Ellie would never let you live down.

A notification appeared saying Dina had entered the chat, and you could immediately see from the three dot animation that she was typing. Ellie must have told her.

“Please ignore Ellie being her usual fucking pain in the ass self. But I made her add me to the chat because I need to know: DID YOU FUCK ABBY ANDERSON?!!! PLEASE TELL ME YOU FUCKED HER. I NEED TO KNOW IF SHE IS AS MUCH OF A SEX GOD AS SHE LOOKS 🙏🙏🙏&nbsp;TELL MEEEEEEEE OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD I HOPE SOMEONE I KNOW GOT TO TAP THAT FINELY CHISELLED PIECE OF ASS!!!”

You laughing bodily, imagining the look on Dina’s face that she always wore when digging for dirt from your dating adventures. It felt good to laugh, to feel a positive emotion after the hollowness that had plagued you for most of the afternoon.

Goddamn, you missed Dina so much in that moment. You two had always had similar taste in women. Except for Ellie, of course. That would’ve been *so* weird.

You started typing, deleting, and then typing again, and a message appeared from Ellie in the meantime.

“YAWN fess up already. We don’t have all day over here. Babies to feed, diapers to change. 🥱”

You summoned your courage, typing, “Well, if you must know, yes, I did sleep with Abby 😬”

The chat exploded.

“HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA ohhhhh fuckkkk I’m crying over here duuuude she is such a square. The puffer vests. I can’t. 😂&nbsp;” Ellie responded. She was being such a shit, per usual.

“IGNORE MY STUPID WIFE,” Dina responded. “She’s just jealous because Abby is the crown jewel of lesbians on that mountain, and arguably, in all of New England. I swear to god, if she tried to pick me up, I would 1000000% go for it. I mean, that’s assuming I wasn’t married to *this* idiot, ofc.”

“Hey! I’m twice the woman Abby Adamson is! She wishes she was this good. 😏” You could imagine Ellie’s sulky face in her text.

“Yeah, and twice the pain in the ass 🙄&nbsp;and it’s Abby ANDERSON, dumbass.”

Goddamn, you really missed Dina. She got you. She was also ruthless when it came to tearing down Ellie when she was in peak obnoxious mode like this.

“Pfffft, whatever.” Ellie continued sulking. “Anyway, you two carry on your thirst fest. *Some* of us have to go care for a JJ like a responsible parent.”

“What Ellie’s *not* telling you is that I looked after JJ all night last night while she went out and got completely blazed with her friends at a concert.”

“Hey, it was the Kill Rock Stars showcase concert! It’s like a once a year thing!” Ellie protested.

“Go away now. Go care for our progeny. 👋👋👋”

You were dying of laughter. You loved Ellie, but you loved seeing her taken down a peg by Dina even more. All you could do is mash the ‘Face with Tears of Joy’ emoji into your phone over and over, delighted that Ellie was receiving her comeuppance.

About thirty seconds later, your phone started vibrating and Dina’s name and photo filled the screen.

“Heyyyyyy,” you answered immediately.

“Sorry about my inane wife, she’s in fiiiiine form tonight,” Dina scoffed.

“It’s fine. After nearly thirty years of friendship, I’m *wayyyy* too used to it,” you said with a resigned chuckle.

“Ellie’s feeding JJ and putting him to sleep, which should take at least fifteen minutes. So: will you do an exhausted new mom who hasn’t had the physical or emotional energy to have sex since her child was born a favour, and tell me just how mind-blowing an experience it was to fuck *the* Abby Anderson? That woman is like… a reincarnation of an Amazon or something, I swear to god,” and she sounded as thirsty as you’d felt on Sunday evening when you’d first met Abby yourself.

“I can’t believe you two know her, jesus,” you scoffed back, shaking your head in disbelief.

“Oh, yeah, Ellie’s mom met her a few years back while she was out snowshoeing or something random like that! Said she felt sorry for her being all by herself in that house over the holidays, so she invited her to the Christmas dinners over the last couple of years. She seems perfectly nice. Like a little bit serious, maybe? But jesus fucking christ, those *arms*,” Dina said the last word with heavy emphasis.

“Oh my god, I know, right?!” you revelled at the memory of them.

Dina started dying with laughter. “Every time she came to Christmas, I’m constantly asking her to pass me plates and so on just so I could see her biceps ripple under those plaid shirts she looks oh so fine wearing,” Dina was cracking up with laughter as she continued. “It drives Ellie completely fucking nuts with jealousy, she does that stupid little huffy face she does. But she always puts in extra effort in bed afterwards to remind me why I’m with her. So I get to have my sexy muscle butch eye candy *and* good sex, too!”

You laughed, delighted. “Oh my god, Dina, I fucking love you. No wonder Ellie was going on about her like that. I can *totally* imagine Ellie getting all bristly and desperate for your attention like she does whenever we are checking people out at Pride.”

“Oh, I wish I could send you a photo. It’s perfection, I totally ham it up just to fuck with her. Ellie constantly needs to be brought down a peg or 10 at any given moment, so it’s a community service, really,” she responded, voice full of mirth. “Anyway, there’s more important things to discuss than my egomaniac of a wife. Sex with Abby. I need to know. Is she as hot as she looks under the plaid shirts and puffer vests? She’s a top, right? She’s gotta be a top. PLEASE TELL ME SHE’S A TOP OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WE NEED HER TO BE A TOP!”

You laughed, delighted that you were getting to spill the tea about this with a friend like Dina.

“Wellllll, I don’t like to kiss and tell—”

“Oh, *fuck off* don’t you dare give me that bullshit!” she huffed in protest.

“Look, you’re totally right: I love to kiss and tell. But I feel… *weird* about it this time,” you said awkwardly.

“Why? Did something happen?”

“Yeah, kinda…” and your voice trailed off.

“Are you… is everything okay with you?” Dina said, voice filled with concern.

“No, it’s nothing like that, I’m fine. It’s just… you know I took that job at the consulting place on the harbour?”

“Yeahhhhh?” Dina answered, confused about how this was relevant.

Dina was silent, waiting expectantly for you to continue. You took a deep breath. “She’s… she’s on my fucking project team.”

“No. She is not! There’s no *way*!” and Dina was practically yelling into the phone. You heard Ellie yell something in the background, and Dina hissed back at her with a slightly raised voice, “Shhhh Ellie, I swear to god, if you wake JJ up and I have to deal with him not sleeping all night, there will be hell to pay!” Her regular phone voice returned. “She’s so infuriating. Sorry. You were saying?”

“So… yeah, Abby’s on my goddamned team at work.”

“Oh jesus. That is so… what are even the *chances* of that? How are you? Are you ok? I mean, after all the stuff at Johns Hopkins… I know that really messed you up.”

“Yeahhhhh it was awkward but ok, for the first few days at least. But we had this massive disagreement today.”

“You or her?” Dina asked.

“Well, first me at her… but then I said something…” you sighed, embarrassed, “well, I said something really fucking dumb about her having a trust fund and a fancy cabin,” you cringed.

“Ohhh nooo,” Dina said in a knowing voice, “did you… did you *know* about her dad?”

“Yup. Yeah. Uh-huh. Surrrre did,” you replied with embarrassment through gritted teeth, feeling so ashamed now you were admitting it to a friend you trusted.

“Ohhhhhhhh *noooooooo*,” and her voice winced even more dramatically than before.

“I know. Fuck. I feel like such an asshole,” you said shaking your head, disappointed in yourself.

“Well—what did she say to you *first*?” Dina asked.

“It’s complicated. I told her I didn’t think we should date while we were working together—”

“Because Doctor, I’m assuming?” Dina interjected.

“Yeah, exactly. She was being really dismissive of what I was saying, and then she took something I said really poorly I think, and got defensive, and tried to make it out like it was no big deal…”

“Ahhhh I’m sensing some parallels here?” she queried gently. “And did you maybe kinda sorta have a tiny baby bit of a trauma response, perhaps?” Dina asked, a little tentatively. Dina had *always* been more emotionally intelligent than you and Ellie combined.

“Yeahhhhh you betcha! I sure did,” highlighting your immense discomfort with sarcastic and self-deprecating cheeriness. God, it was so wretched admitting all this to someone else. “I really didn’t mean to explode. I just, I don’t understand why she got so defensive, though. And then I just… reacted. Fuck. It was horrible.”

“Ohhh, I’m sure it wasn’t *that* bad, and you *do* love to catastrophise from time to time,” she teased.

“Dina. I fucking made her cry.”

“Oooof.” You could *hear* the face Dina was making on the other end of the phone. You heard Ellie yell something in the background. “Ellie, if you yell one more time, so help me god,” Dina hissed loudly back at her. “Sorry about that. So, you made Abby Anderson *cry*? She’s like… possibly the most stoic butch I’ve ever met in my entire life.”

“Yeah, well—yours truly made her cry in a print room.”

“Fuuuuck,” Dina commiserated. “So, what are you gonna do about it? I mean, you have to work with her still, right? Won’t that be…”

“Awkward as hell? Yes, that’s what I’m expecting,” you said, your tone slightly manic. You both went quiet for a moment.

“You know, last Christmas, I needed to go to that market at the bottom of the mountain, and I was pregnant as fuck and the road was a bit icy and Ellie was too drunk on Joel’s ridiculous eggnog to drive, *of course*,” she groaned, “and so Abby offered to drive me. We walked into the market and I swear she got checked out by practically every woman in the building. I mean, half of the women round there are lesbians escaping the city anyway, but like a bunch of the women there with men seemed to be thirsting over her too, it was wild. Anyway, we had this really surprising chat on the way back in the car when I brought it up. I asked her why she was still single when she could basically date anyone she wanted. And she said something about how the people who are interested in her always just assume she’s some kind of toppy butch stereotype and fawn over the *idea* of her, but it’s always superficial. She said something like, *’They never get to know the real me,’* and so she just finds dating boring as hell for the most part and mostly does one night stands. It made me really sad, actually,” Dina finished plainly.

“Hmm. Interesting. She said something like that when she was…” your voice trailed off again.

“I think you going to say, *‘railing you into next week’* and then tell me all the sexy details, right?” Dina said with great enthusiasm.

“Dina,” you scolded, “I can’t believe you *said* that after everything you just told me about her. And *I’m* the horrible person?”

“Oh, shut up. You’re definitely the asshole here,” she laughed, and you let out a huff. “So—you’re really gonna tell me *nothing* about the hot night you had with Abby the lumberjack? You’re one heartless bitch, you know that?” and you both laughed again. “Come on, just give me like, one little snippet,” and then, she dropped her voice to a low whisper, “I swear I will never utter a word to Ellie.”

“Okay okay okay… I guess I could give you, like, a few harmless details,” you capitulated, “but only one one condition,” and she made a murmur of agreement, “if you *ever* tell Ellie, *I’ll* tell her about that one night stand you had before you two got together who did the thing with their tongue—”

She cut in: “I will NEVER tell Ellie. And I can’t *believe* you’d invoke The One Night Stand story. Damn, you *are* one heartless bitch,” and you both laughed scandalously. “Well played, though. Now: spill the tea.”

“Okay. Well, number one, she’s definitely a top. The toppiest. My lord. She could probably top Ellie.”

“Hah! I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy,” Dina snorted derisively, and you chortled, because Dina had told you many times about how much of a brat Ellie was in bed, “but continue.”

“Number two, she kinda really liked being bottomed?” you said, and it was more of a question than a statement, like you couldn’t really believe what you were saying.

“What?! Huh. *That* I did *not* expect,” Dina scoffed.

“Right? Like, don’t get me wrong, she was still *super* toppy the whole time I was eating her out—and it was hot as hell, you wouldn’t believe—”

“Oh no, I *would.* I would *absolutely* believe,” Dina assured you eagerly.

You chuckled in response. “Fair point. And number three: she fucked me so hard that I basically couldn’t move my legs. But then like, she carried me upstairs, and I woke up in the morning and she was spooning me, and she made me breakfast and it was really cute, and sweet, and interesting and it felt like…”

“Like…? Like what?!” Dina urged you, when you’d said nothing for a few seconds.

“Liiiiike… it wasn’t a one night thing,” and you paused, and you felt like you’d sound nuts if you said what you were thinking.

“Just *say* it, don’t leave me hanging here,” Dina bemoaned.

“Honestly? It was like, the best intimacy I’d ever experienced after sex. Like, we’d been together for years. It was just… easy. It was weird, and unexpected. But a *warm fuzzy feeling all over your body* kind of amazing. It sounds crazy, I know,” you finished, a little confused.

“Huh.”

“Yeah,” you replied.

You both fell silent again, but then Dina started talking, and she was a little tentative.

“So I’m gonna have to go in a sec, because baby, but—look, hear me out. I know you feel wretched right now, and you think she probably hates you, and doesn’t ever want to talk to you again.”

“I have no idea what you are talking about, Dina, because I never, *ever* feel that way about conflict,” you said, the sarcasm dripping richly off your tongue.

“Mmmhmm,” she sassed, and continued. “anyway—I think you should just reach out to her and apologise. I don’t know her that well, really, but I got the sense she’s… kindof old fashioned, you know? Like a woman of principal, maybe? I mean, Ellie’s right, she’s *definitely* a square—but not in a naïve way. I think she’s just been through some shit and had to grow up pretty fast without any real support. I reckon if you just spoke with her, owned your bullshit, and talked it out, she might listen.”

“Ugh, I don’t know, Dina—she seemed pretty pissed at me when she stormed out of our convo today,” you said not wanting to get your hopes up.

“Yeah, but, what have you got to lose? I mean, worst case, you’ve tried to make things right with a colleague you had an argument with. It might not go how you want, but at least you will have tried. And best case—”

“I’ll be swallowed up by a hole in the space-time continuum and cease to exist?”

“Ha ha. No, smartass,” Dina laughed, “best case is you end up with a hot fucking lumberjack wife and her trusty strap.”

“Pffft, there is no way that’s going to happen.”

“Yeah, well, your odds may not be great *right now*, but you’ll never know if you never try,” Dina finished, an air of maturity in her voice.

“I hate when you get all… sensible and wise. It’s so annoying,” you mocked.

“You love me,” she responded loftily.

“I do. I do I fucking love you. You’re the best. But, god, why on earthy did you marry my best friend. She’s fucking insufferable sometimes.”

“She’s fucking insufferable most of the time. But she makes me laugh more than should be humanly possible. Annnnnnd I get you as a bestie, too, which is the real win. So—there’s that!”

“Awwww, love you too, bestieeeee,” you said, doing your best impression of a teenager on social media.

In the background, you heard Ellie’s voice in the background as she mumbled something to Dina you couldn’t hear.

“No I will *not* tell you, moron, because you can’t keep your mouth shut to save yourself,” Dina bit back at whatever Ellie had said. “Okay, I better go, gotta get food sorted.”

“’Kay. Hey Dina—thanks for the chat. I really mean it,” you said earnestly.

“Anytime, babe,” she said kindly, and you both hung up.

Later that night, you were sat up in bed, having typed and deleted a message to Abby for what felt like the dozenth time.

Fuck, why does this have to be so hard, you thought.

A heaving sigh to escaped your lips.

*Just fucking type something and send it*, you implored yourself.

You took a deep breath, mashed your fingers at the keyboard on your phone, and hit send.

“Okay universe,” you uttered, eyes closed and uncertainty plaguing you the moment you’d sent it, “I’m trying to make things better. Can you please, please give me some good shit back, just this once?”

You opened your eyes, and looked down at your message.

Read 10:14pm, it said.

And then, nothing.

You woke up the next morning at 6:30am so you could get to the gym on time for yoga with Jordan.

As you were riding the elevators up to the gym, you looked for about the fifth time that morning at the message you’d sent Abby the previous night. It read:

*“Hey, Abby. I hope it’s ok I message you. I think we should talk about what happened, so that the project work isn’t so awkward for us both. Do you have some time tomorrow or Friday?”*

Abby, disappointingly, had still not replied.

*Fuck fuck fuck.*

Jordan was waiting for you in a pair of galaxy print tights and a glittery black crop top, and they’d clipped up their hair with a large plastic, shimmery-purple hair clip that matched their purple-tinged eyeshadow.

“Well, those pants *certainly* don’t disappoint, do they?” Jordan sassed playfully.

You did, in fact, wear your comfiest coral pink sweats that featured fluoro yellow ‘Smiling Face with Sunglasses’ emoji all over them. Ellie and Dina had sent them to you for the holidays last year, and while they were a complete eyesore, you love-hated every square inch of them. Jordan looked suitably revolted by them, too, which felt like a crowning achievement at 7:25am.

The yoga class itself had been okay. You hid on a mat in the back corner of the small studio next to Jordan and did a bunch of down dog and warrior pose, before spending the rest of the session stretching out your legs comfortably on the mat while doing breathing exercises.

Jordan had to run off immediately after the class finished to get to the front desk by 8:30am, so after taking a long shower in the definitely very-bougie change facilities, you strolled towards the exit, which led you directly past the the weights area.

And of course, who was there doing deadlifts while Manny stood by spotting her?

Manny—dressed in a pair of basketball shorts and a mesh singlet—waved you over when he saw you, and when Abby realised who he had gestured to, she rolled her eyes and looked away.

“Hey! Great to see you again,” Manny said in a way that was almost *too* enthusiastic. Had she told him about what had happened between the two of you yesterday? *Almost certainly*, you thought to yourself.

“Uhhh heyyyy Manny… hey Abby,” you replied in an awkward greeting, trying to smile and meet her gaze.

Abby turned to Manny, deliberately avoiding your eyes. “I gotta go get some water,” she said, taking her noticeably half-full water bottle with her as she walked towards the water cooler.

She was wearing a black t-shirt with the sleeves cut off and long black tights that made her thighs and butt look so damned good. You felt guilty for looking, given all that had happened the day prior. Manny followed your eyes with his as you watched her walk away. Her freckled arms and neck were flushed a slight shade of pink from her workout.

“So uh, how’s things with you?” he asked surveying you with a raised eyebrow and a stern look that told you he already knew everything about yesterday’s argument.

“I suppose Abby told you about our… disagreement?” you asked, and he nodded. “Ugh, Manny…” you let out a massive sigh, and your face dropped sullenly. “I really fucked up yesterday. I said something in the heat of the moment and it was really dumb and I think Abby hates me. I feel like such an asshole.” The lump in your throat was back, and your eyes returned to where Abby was standing on the other side of the large weights area where she was fixing her hair back into a messy bun, biceps flexing majestically as she did so. Fuck, she was so gorgeous. What had you even been thinking? Who *wouldn’t* want to date her? You felt so stupid.

You returned to look at Manny, eyebrows furrowed with disappointment.

“Yeah, look, she was pretty upset when she texted me last night,” he said with a chastising look. “Why would you *say* something like that? It’s a pretty shitty thing to do, you know,” and he raised his eyebrows at you, and waited expectantly for an answer.

“It’s… nothing to do with her. I mean, it is a little, but—the way I reacted—I felt like she wasn’t hearing me. I had a really awful experience at one of my last workplaces with a… a *colleague*...” you stressed the word euphemistically, “and I guess I’m still hanging on to a lot of hurt from that. But—but that’s not an excuse,” you said hurriedly, looking at him earnestly. “What I said to her was really, *really* shitty,” and you sighed, your face forlorn.

Manny’s head nodded in agreement, and he looked like he was trying to decide if your apology was suitably self-flagellating. Across the room, Abby was now being very thorough about emptying and refilling her water bottle, and stretching out her shoulders while looking anywhere else but where you and Manny stood.

“Yeah it was really shitty,” he said, fixing you with a reproachful gaze, “*but*—” he continued, “Abby *can* also be a bit of an oblivious dumbass when it comes to other people’s feelings,” and his eyes softened as he said this. “I should know. We’ve been friends since college, and she was a lot more of a dumbass than she is now,” and his face shifted to a wry smile. “Give her a few days, she might come round.”

“Yeah. Yeah, thanks Manny, I appreciate the suggestion,” and a rueful smile pulled at the corners of your mouth.

“Sure thing, just—don’t make my girl sad again, okay?” and he put his hands in the pockets of his gym shorts and gave you a little nod farewell. You nodded back in thanks and turned to leave. Over your shoulder, you heard him call out to Abby across the gym floor: “*Oye,* Anderson, quit slacking off! You still owe me two more sets of deads. No way you’ll beat out Carol for the record at this rate,” he taunted.

“Yeah, yeah, *hermano*, don’t be bitter just because I still outlift you at the bench,” you heard her reply, voice full of swagger.

You walked toward the exit, turning back with a furtive look towards Abby, whose back was to you as she was bent at the waist, preparing for the lift. Your eyes goggled at the tension in her perfectly-muscled body as she smoothly lifted the heavily-laden barbell for eight reps, before dropping it to the mat with a thud and a clatter.

A hiss of hot air escaped your lips in admiration of the sheer power this woman possessed, and you turned towards the exit and headed upstairs to the office wishing beyond hope that you could make things okay between the two of you.

<h3>Chapter End Notes</h3>
<p>The next chapter is about halfway done! I ended up splitting the chapter again as it was getting loooooong and it felt like leaving it on the precipice of a bit of angst and uncertainty will make Abby and Reader's coming back together more explosive after being so painfully drawn out (don't worry, I'm getting impatient, too!).
Fear not, though, more smut on the horizon in the next one or two chapters, but for now, I need to make us all suffer just a liiiiiiittle bit longer!
Thanks for all your comments after the last chapter. It really gives me a great hit of encouragement and helps fuel the writing! Please drop any further comments and let me know what you think of how we're working through things!</p>

<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>“Youuuu… said something today. You said… I distracted you. I made you nervous…” her voice trailed off.
“Oh… yeah, I… I guess I did say that,” you replied, fidgeting with your fingers a little awkwardly.
All of a sudden, your senses were sharpened, and your breathing shallowed. You pressed your lips together and and looked anywhere other than at Abby’s face, which was now inclined in your direction as she studied your features carefully with that unreadable look.
“What… did I do that made you nervous? ” she asked gingerly.
You paused, uncertain of how to respond. “I… I’m not sure I should answer that,” you said, avoiding the question.
--
Abby's been avoiding you, despite your best efforts to talk to her about what happened, and to make matters worse, your crush on her somehow grows the more time passes.
But when things go awry in a meeting with Isaac and she comes to your rescue, you're left figuring out whether she is just being a good colleague, or if there is more to her reaction than she's letting on.
Nothing helps colleagues to work through their issues than pulling an all-nighter to keep an important client happy, you suppose.</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>We're back! Thanks so much for your patience. Things have been crazy busy, and I've been chipping away day by day to figure out how to bring our babes back together in a way that feels authentic to their characters and the progression of the story.
I have good news and bad news for y'all:
The good news is that Abby and Reader are defo getting back together this chapter. Woo! Party!
The bad, sad, not very glad news is that you'll have to wait to the start of the next chapter for all the smutty goodness, as it took a bit longer than expected to get us where we need to be for all of this to coalesce in a late at night working together in an empty FFL&amp;Y office.
But in return for your patience, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of tantalisingly *real* Reader angst as they work through their feels for Abby</li>
<li>Lots of indecipherable glances in office-related settings</li>
<li>A bit of character development for everyone's fave sidekick, Manny</li>
<li>Abby teasing us all with her outstanding butt in that blue suit we met previously, and with her tie loosened and the top button of her business shirt undone</li>
<li>The promise of oodles of 'finally giving in to our feelings' smut, PLUS Abby in tennis shorts, coming your way next chapter!
Fun times ahead! Hope you enjoy all the yearning in the meantime!

</aside>

An angst-filled few weeks had passed since you’d seen Abby and Manny at the gym, and things between the two of you were still very much unresolved, and your text message to her had gone unanswered.

Abby had successfully dodged every opportunity you might have had to speak with her. She rushed off immediately after meetings, and was almost always on the phone with a client when she was on her own.

She’d basically avoided you as much as humanly possible whenever you were in the office at the same time—which seemed to be an increasingly rare occurrence these days, though whether this was by coincidence or on purpose, you weren’t sure—and she seemed noticeably more busy than when you’d first started at FFL&Y.

While she wasn’t around much during the day, you’d often see email notifications from her well past 11pm, and even the occasional message to the team chat after midnight. She looked tired and serious all the time, and you’d even overheard a few terse conversations between Abby and Nora, including one where Abby had told Nora rather loudly to stop bringing her in to “clean up the messes made by incompetent old white dudes who were too busy playing golf to learn how to operate a spreadsheet correctly.” You’d even caught *Mel* smirking at that one.

Because Abby seemed incapable of making any time to talk with you, you had made one last attempt to repair things by getting her an Americano when it was your turn to do the now-daily 10am team coffee run that rotated between yourself, Mel and Owen. You’d marched into her office uninvited, deposited the cup on her desk, and had given her an uncertain half-smile. She’d raised her head, furrowed brows looking between your face and the coffee cup in puzzlement, and that unreadable look in her eyes. You’d sighed, resigned, turned on your heels and left her office before she could say anything.

By now, you’d basically assumed it would continue like this with her ad infinitum, and that would be that, so you’d resigned yourself to doing your job well and keeping focused on your printmaking in your free time.

Your brand identity presentation with Isaac had gone well enough, and Owen and Mel had done their bit to hype up the work you’d done and steer Isaac towards the brand you all agreed was the standout. You’d even gotten a short utterance of “Hmmm, good,” from Isaac at the end of the presentation—not the most glowing commentary you’d ever heard from a client, but from Isaac, you’d take it as enthusiastic praise.

You’d started on the illustration work for the pitch document a few weeks ago, using the information the research team had provided you. Today, you were scheduled to meet with Isaac at his office to take him through the concepts you’d come up with thus far so you could update the draft of the investor document you’d almost finished.

Team standup that morning was relatively brief, as everything was on track. Heinous sweaters aside, Owen had turned out to be a surprisingly effective project manager, and he was nearly as good at managing Isaac’s bristly personality as Abby was.

“Oh, Abby and Manny will be joining you at the meeting with Isaac today,” Owen mentioned as an aside, whilst going through the tasks for today. “They’ve got some financials and legal bits and pieces to talk through with him, so I figured it made sense to combine your design review with their conversations. Isaac’s availability is really limited right now,” and he finished by giving you a thumbs up.

“Oh. Okay, sure,” you’d replied a little hesitantly, with a glance in Abby’s direction.

She responded without looking up from her phone. “I’ll drive. Be ready to leave at 1:15,” she said curtly.

Owen carried on, oblivious to whatever was going on between the two of you, so you said nothing and turned back towards the whiteboard. He was stepping through the high priority items coming up, and what everyone was responsible for. You were nodding your head now and then, but barely paying attention. Instead, you snuck the occasional sideways glance towards Abby, but she was either talking directly with Owen and Mel, or doing something on her phone.

She had taken to standing on the opposite side of the standup huddle to you, avoiding your gaze at all costs. Aside from her earlier comment about driving to the meeting just now, she’d hardly said a word to you in days.

As you cast another small, furtive glance in her direction, you saw her smile at whatever she was looking at on her phone before tapping away at the keyboard. You felt your heart pang, wishing that she’d just talk with you so you could smooth things over, or even just acknowledge you existed in some way—in *any* way, really.

How had it come to this? From the first night you met, when things felt effortless, to her flirting with you in the office, seemingly wanting you so badly, to *this*: this awkward, avoidant, miserable *whatever-this-was* with her. You’d started to get an anxious feeling in the pit of your stomach every time you saw her, coupled with a longing to just… go back to how things were before everything had disintegrated between the two of you.

You’d noticed yourself staring at her in presentation meetings, including one time earlier this week when she’d been presenting the latest version of the investment offerings to Isaac. You were sitting at the back of the boardroom table next to Mel, but instead of looking at the screen, you’d been gazing across the table at Abby as she explained the different costing tiers in a way that demonstrated the depth of her economic prowess. Every time Isaac had asked a question or suggested a change, she’d done an expert job of taking on his ideas and discussing him through the options, but more often than not, her ideas ended up prevailing as the most sound ones.

She was exacting and meticulous, and her calm, steady confidence was so reassuring. Whenever the team wasn’t sure what the right way forward was, Abby would matter-of-factly bring up some study or article she’d read that would invariably help you all decide the best approach. Whenever Isaac was flipping out about some inconsequential detail, or on the days he was in a bristly mood, Abby would come in at just the right time with the perfect response that would quell his concerns, or she would distract him with small talk about science or business or sport that he found interesting and would put him in a better mood.

She was charming in the moments she needed to be and seemed effortlessly comfortable in the spotlight, but she didn’t feel the need to make herself the centre of attention. She commanded respect and spoke with authority, but she wasn’t domineering like Isaac; didn’t feel the need to remind everyone in the room of the power she could easily wield if she wanted to.

*Why can’t she be like that with me, though*, you’d wondered on more than a few occasions in the last few weeks. Where was all that level-headed diplomacy when it came to the two of you?

It wasn’t like you were expecting a miracle: at this point, you knew nothing was going to happen between you both, not now that you had clearly, irreparably screwed things up with her; *that* much, she had made exceedingly clear. But couldn’t she just be *civil*? She seemed determined to punish you, or at least, avoid you in a way that *felt* like a punishment.

And worst of all, your feelings towards her—the ones that had, in those first days you’d met her, comprised an attraction unrivalled in recent memory *and* a whole lot of thirst for her extraordinary physique—had now been replaced by a lump in your throat and an ache deep within your chest every time you were in the same room as her.

She’d caught you looking forlornly in her direction a few days ago when, late one afternoon, she’d spun around on her office chair while on a call: she’d faltered upon meeting your eyes, and you’d blushed and quickly looked away, annoyed and a little embarrassed that this was the first time in what felt like weeks that she’d even *looked* at you. After that, you’d made an excuse to Owen that you were feeling unwell and could you work from home for the rest of the day so you wouldn’t have to sit through the project team meeting that afternoon in the same room as her.

The one saving grace right now was that, things with Abby aside, Nora and Owen were pleased with your design work, and Isaac had seemingly started to chill out a bit now you’d proven your ability to deliver great work for him.

*That has to count for something*, you kept reminding yourself. Yes, things with Abby were awkward and miserable, but at least you’d been able to nail the brand design, and Isaac seemed content with your progress on the various layouts and illustrations you’d been working on to create the pitch documents. Nora had even offered to extend your contract, which you’d gladly accepted given how competitive the freelance market was at present, and it meant a few more months of consistent, well-paid work to fund your exhibition costs and printmaking supplies.

You had to be content with that for now, and hope things with Abby would improve eventually—or at the very least, she’d smile at you from time to time. Or just… not seem so hostile?

“Okay, so! That’s it for today!” Owen’s chirpy tone pulled you from your daze. “Who’s turn is it for the coffee run?” he asked, looking between yourself and Mel.

“Mine, I think,” you said with forced cheerfulness that *seemed* convincing enough. “Same as usual?” you asked them.

Mel responded with a grateful, “Yes, please!” and Owen requested a venti instead of his usual grande before they both settled at their desks for the morning.

“Sure thing,” you replied with a nod. You turned your head, and saw Abby walk silently towards her office, already talking with whoever she was now on the phone with. A resigned sigh escaped your lips, as you turned and began walking towards the elevators.

It was a busy morning of adjustments to the diagrams you were working on for the meeting with Isaac, including a complete overhaul of the colour palette you’d taken the team through yesterday that you’d explained would improve accessibility.

Manny appeared at your desk after lunch with a beaming smile across his cheeks as you were packing up your satchel.

“Eyyyy, how you doing? Ready to go?” he quizzed energetically. He was dressed in a smart, dark grey wool suit, with a simple white satin pocket square flourishing from the breast pocket of his jacket. His eyes sparkled warmly as he addressed you.

You’d actually gotten to know Manny quite well in these past few weeks. Once he’d gotten over the fact that you’d slighted the person who was basically like a sister to him, you’d both realised you had a lot in common outside of work.

You both appreciated nature, though he preferred the water, whereas you were all about trees.

You both loved art, and he knew quite a few of the artists you admired. He had even been to Japan once and was somewhat familiar with the ukiyo-e woodblock prints that heavily influenced your printmaking practice.

Like you, he was from a working-class family—although his family had become more middle-class as his mother’s art career had taken off over the years. He’d shared with you that his mother was a painter and his family had moved to the US after a residency she’d done decades ago. Throughout his childhood, she had taken him to all the big galleries in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and a variety of others on the family’s various travels. He’d met Abby at Harvard, where they both studied business, both worked at the theatre on campus as ushers, and had both played varsity sports—Abby, baseball; and Manny, tennis. They had ended up at the same parties frequently enough that they just eventually became friends. She’d helped him study for his economics exams, and he’d been like the brother she’d never had, shepherding her through a parentless early adulthood, and even having her join his family for the holidays on occasion.

Yes, Manny was chronically extroverted and arrogant, but but underneath all the bravado, it turned out he was actually a pretty decent guy. He seemed to know *everyone* in the office and had a way of ensuring sure those around him always felt included. He’d swung by your desk on more than a few occasions and asked if you wanted to head with him to the coffee cart, and you’d even had a drink after work together one day where you’d had a surprisingly nuanced conversation about Diane Arbus and the ethics of photography with marginalised communities.

And so, at 1:07pm that afternoon, when Manny sidled up to your desk asking if you were ready to go, it brought a little ease to your mind knowing that you wouldn’t be doing the whole trip to Isaac’s office in awkward silence with Abby. Sweet relief!

Less than 10 minutes later, you were pulling out of the basement carpark in Abby’s Jeep, while Manny was talking you both through his upcoming plans for the long weekend ahead: sailing with friends, and a tennis tournament.

“Oh but Abs,” Manny continued, “Meena pulled out as my doubles partner—sister’s getting her wisdom teeth out or something,” he said with disappointment. “*You* said you were free this weekend, though, right? I was thinking maybe we could team up again! Remember how much we destroyed at the work tourney? We could relive the glory!” he declared, selling the dream in an attempt to rouse her competitive spirit.

You caught sight of Abby’s face scrunched up in irritation in the reflection of the rearview mirror, and before you could think, you blurted out, “Wait, you destroy at tennis as well?”

“What do you mean ’as well’?” she shot back, eyes glancing suspiciously at you in the rearview mirror before darting back to the road.

Shit. “Uhh, it’s just… Manny mentioned… Harvard, and baseball..?” you responded nervously.

She flashed Manny a dangerous look.

“Whaaaat?” he looked back unapologetically, laughing at her, “I’m not allowed to talk to my friends about the prime of my youth?” he asked in protest.

She scowled back at him, and shook her head in mild irritation.

“Soooo I’m gonna take that as an enthusiastic yes to the tennis tourney,” Manny said smoothly, and giving her expectant eyes and a confident grin.

She winced, as if in pain. “Ugh, Manny, you’re so annoying. I’m not even that *good* at tennis,” she protested.

“Pendejadas, Abuelita,” he retorted, “we won the final in straight sets last time,” and he turned to look at you in the back seat, “and you should see her lob,” he finished with a smirk and a raised eyebrow. (“*Bullshit, grandma,”)*

You could see Abby roll her eyes in the mirror, but then a satisfied smirk flashed across her face for just a moment.

“So, are you just good at, like, *everything* you do?” you scoffed in bemusement before you could stop yourself.

She caught your eyes in the mirror briefly with a curious look that was half-smugness and half-defiance, but then she seemed to remember she was meant to be avoiding you and turned her eyes back to the road.

“I’m not good at *everything*, I just…” she muttered, and both you and Manny laughed derisively at her obliviousness, and she looked around defensively. “What?! Why are you laughing?! I’m just good at… figuring out how to do… stuff,” she finished weakly.

Your combined laughter continued to escalate.

“Pfft, whatever,” she huffed, petulance in her tone, and pouted sulkily at the road.

“Abs, being amazing at life is not a *bad* thing. I mean, *I* should know,” Manny said, voice dripping with cocky self-assurance, “and *especially* not when you use that *supreme and unquestionable* talent you possess to help *me* win the tennis doubles,” he concluded with a waggle of his eyebrows at her.

She rolled her eyes again and let out a long whine. “God, you’re insufferable, Manny. Fiiiiine. What day and where?” she groaned, resigned to her fate.

“Yeeeees Abuelita! I knew that competitive streak in you couldn’t resist a return to our former championship status,” Manny said, clearly pleased with himself for winning her over. “We are gonna kick some serious *ass*!” and he pumped his fist in the air victoriously.

“Ugh, I just said yes to shut you up. And stop calling me *grandma*,” she huffed in annoyance.

“Of course, of course,” he said hurriedly, hands raised in apology. She responded with a curt nod, but then he quietly added, “*Abuelo*,” and you both snickered once more as she let out a frustrated groan. *(”Grandpa,”)*

You tried to repress your mirth at Manny’s teasing, but it was pretty hard not to laugh at seeing her like this. The normally-composed Abby Anderson—hotshot economist around the office, infinitely capable, devastatingly handsome in a business suit—getting so easily wound up by her best friend’s taunts. It really was a joyful sight to behold.

As you composed yourself, you caught sight of the rearview mirror and found found her eyes fixed in your direction, recognising that unreadable expression you’d becoming all too familiar with. She startled ever so slightly, and her gaze returned back to the road in front of her—but you were certain you could see a flush of crimson climbing her neck and cheek.

You pressed your lips together, turned to face the window, and took a slow, deep breath in an attempt to still the hammering of your heart in your chest.

While Manny talked Abby through the logistics of the tournament over the weekend, you tried to make sense of things.

Had Abby just looked at you and blushed? What did that mean? Was she still interested in you after all this time of seemingly *loathing* you? Was that even *possible?*

*It’s probably nothing,* you told yourself, *There’s no point reading into things, she practically ignores you most of the time.*

*But she’s probably just feeling bad for ignoring you for weeks.*

*Or maybe she’s just annoyed that you’re in her car and she’d rather be chatting with Manny alone.*

*Or maybe she was just looking at you and it doesn’t mean anything at all.*

“Screw you, anxiety. You suck.”

“What did you say?” Abby glanced back at you.

“Huh? Nothing, all good,” you said, trying to sound chill despite the disbelief you’d said your thoughts aloud.

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. Yeah, your anxiety really CAN go to hell.

It was so frustrating that one look from her could so easily set your mind reeling. You took a deep breath, but you could still feel your heart pounding in your chest. The timing of this couldn’t be worse: you were about to head into a meeting with a client who was a complete pain to deal with on a *good* day.

At least you were just taking Isaac through the concepts for the diagrams. But it would sure as hell be nice if your brain wasn’t derailing your every thought by trying to make sense of the enigma that was Abby Anderson.

Before long, you all arrived at Isaac’s office. When his executive assistant Danny showed you to the meeting room, Isaac waved you in while he wrapped up a heated phone call. He was clearly in a tetchy and impatient mood.

You immediately felt nervous, and that—in combination with your already anxious brain overthinking things with Abby—meant you were *not* your usual, confident self as you presented your work. You tripped over your words a few times, and when Isaac challenged you on the new colour palette you were recommending for the illustrations, your mind completely blanked.

As you stood there like a goldfish, your brain trying to find the words, he furrowed his brows, tilted his head to the side in impatience, and let out an audible grunt under his breath to show his displeasure at being kept waiting.

Your eyes darted around the room, and you could feel yourself panicking a little. “Let me just… I’ll bring up my notes…” you mumbled uncharacteristically.

“I’m disappointed that you didn’t bother to come prepared,” he said, his voice escalating in a menacing way, “this *isn’t* amateur hour. This is a *multi-million dollar* program of investment in—”

In the background, you could see Manny’s eyes goggled at Isaac’s rudeness. Manny looked outraged and ready to jump to your defence—but before he could, Abby turned to towards Isaac, leaning casually against the boardroom table with one elbow, and cut him off mid-rant.

“Isaac, we’re all well aware of how important this is. You *know* we wouldn’t come to a meeting unprepared. In all the years we’ve worked together, when has that ever happened?” It was phrased as a question, but it was *very much* a statement. Abby’s tone was even and authoritative, eyebrows raised almost as if in reprimand, and the look she gave him made it patently clear that he was out of line.

She continued. “Now, the reason for the recommended colour palette is that it meets accessibility standards for contrast at these font sizes both online *and* in print. Knowing your investors will likely be over-represented by older white men, the chances of a significant proportion of your them having low vision means that accessibility needs be a priority. You *could* go with the colour palette that you requested in your email earlier this week, but there’s a high likelihood that key details will be at least somewhat illegible for that low-vision cohort.”

She turned to you, leaning forward with her hands clasped before her on the table. “Did I do a reasonable job of summarising what you took us through yesterday afternoon?” and she raised her eyebrows at you in enquiry.

You stood there in stunned silence looking at Abby with no idea how to react. All your senses were suddenly heightened, and you could feel goosebumps forming on your arms.

She’d just saved your ass, *and* managed to make sure she gave you the credit, too.

“Uhh, yeah, you nailed it actually,” you replied, and you could feel your usual confidence begin to wash over you as a restrained-but-thankful smile crept into the corners of your mouth. Abby smiled warmly back at you. Her eyes narrowed just a little, and she gave you a barely-perceptible nod of encouragement as if to say, ‘*You got this’*, before she turned back towards the screen again.

Out of the corner of your eyes you could see Manny—who was out of Isaac’s line of sight—looking *immensely* pleased at the exceedingly professional way Abby had just made it clear to Isaac that he needed to stop being such an asshole.

Isaac’s expression was steely, but he couldn’t seem to find anything Abby had just said unreasonable. He followed suit and turned towards the screen again as well.

“Well, that all makes sense, then,” he said, and his tone was noticeably softer than it had been a minute prior.

You continued going through the key details, agreeing on a few changes that needed to be made, and Isaac was even agreeable to you getting some time with the research team to proof the illustrations some time in the next week.

When you’d finished going through everything with him, he even let out a polite *‘Thankyou’,* which you returned with a brief *‘No problem,’* before handing the conversation over to Abby and Manny.

Relieved that things had worked out in the end, you sat quietly as the discussion turned to indicative projections on investment returns and strategies for mitigating legal risks with the company structure, and started to digest what had just unfolded.

Abby had just saved your ass, defended your professional integrity, and essentially told a client they were out of line for how they spoke with you in the process.

So did this mean that the whole time you’d been talking through your design updates in the team meetings, and it had *looked* like Abby was distracted by her phone or writing emails on her laptop, she’d actually been *paying attention*? And not *just* paying attention—but paying *enough* attention to be able to describe back in pretty damn good detail why you’d made the decisions you had to the client.

*So what does THAT mean?* you wondered to yourself.

*This means she’s not been completely ignoring you, obviously.*

*Well, at least not in a work capacity. This could all just be good, collegiate behaviour.*

*Yeah, but if she hasn’t been completely ignoring you in a work capacity and you couldn’t tell she was paying attention, maybe she’s also not been ignoring you in OTHER ways.*

*Hmm, let’s just slow down here, no need to get ahead of ourselves. She could very well still be pissed for the dumb shit you said a few weeks back. And let’s not forget about The Doctor, right? You don’t wanna wind up hurt no matter how much you want her. Right? RIGHT?*

You were trying your best to be calm and rational, but in this moment, your brain kept veering hopelessly back to one tiny but nonetheless-real possibility: what if, in spite of all that had happened, Abby was somehow still *into you*?

At just the thought of that, your heartbeat kick-started an incessant thud beneath your rib cage. You chewed your lip as you turned things over in your mind.

For the rest of the meeting, you did your best to follow the conversation, but your thoughts kept drifting back to Abby.

How she’d *defended* you.

How she’d *smiled* at you.

How she’d *looked* at you in the rearview mirror.

You gulped, hoping beyond hope that there might still be a chance.

The meeting ended, and Isaac seemed to have settled after his dressing-down from Abby, even giving you a brief, *‘Thanks for your good work,’* when you were both out of earshot of Abby and Manny. It so shocked you so much that all you could muster in response was a nervous, *‘Of course.’*

As soon as the three of you were out of the building and walking back to the car, Manny turned to Abby with glee.

“Abs, that was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen,” he gushed proudly. “Damn, I thought he was gonna *flip* when you said that, but he just—wow! I’ve never *seen* him like that,” Manny punched you affectionately on the arm before adding, “Wasn’t that *insane*?”

“Yeah, not gonna lie, that was *pretty* wild to watch. Thanks for, uh, saving my ass,” you finished, with a shy smile of gratitude.

Abby didn’t say anything, just looked in your direction and returned the smile back in your direction. Manny seemed to catch on to the quiet exchange, eyes darting between the two of you before glancing at his phone.

“Oh shit? I *completely* forgot about a meeting I have across town,” he said, now fidgeting frantically with his phone.

“Sure thing, we can drop you there on the way back,” Abby offered.

“Nah, I’ll book an Uber, it’s in completely the opposite direction,” he said.

“You sure?”

“Yeah, ‘course!”&nbsp;he quipped, and then, “Oh shit, it’s only a minute away, I’ll see you tomorrow!” he said, rushing off towards his pickup location.

“Uhhhh, ‘kayyyy, bye Manny, I guess,” she laughed to herself, as he was already well out of earshot. She walked towards the Jeep, and you followed along behind, doing your best to avoid staring at how good her butt looked in the navy business suit she wore today—the same one she’d worn on the first day you met her. Strands of her blonde hair had escaped the messy bun, but she somehow still looked neat and tidy in spite of this.

She unlocked the Jeep, deposited her laptop and suit jacket on the back seat, and got in.

You faltered as you went to open the door. The last time you had sat in the front seat of this car, things with you and Abby had been completely different. It felt like that had occurred an age ago.

You opened the door, and climbed into the front seat, putting your satchel on the floor between your feet. You felt acutely aware of everything all of a sudden.

Abby started the engine, and Sam Cooke began playing through the speakers. She pulled out her sunglasses and donned them: the same ones she’d been wearing that morning when she’d dropped you back at the Williams’s cabin.

“Good to go?” she asked you, turning towards you with one hand on the wheel and the other on the gear stick.

Now that she'd divested herself of her suit jacket, you could see all the tantalising ways in which her well-tailored white business shirt clung to her chiselled torso. She was still wearing her skinny black necktie, which added to the thirst you were presently experiencing, and she looked so damned fine in those sunglasses that you gulped.

“Yup,” you replied, as casually as you could manage, desperately trying to compose yourself.

“Cool,” she responded, and pulled towards the exit of the parking lot.

A few minutes passed with just the sound of the music playing. Abby’s eyebrows were narrowed in concentration and she seemed to be turning something over in her mind.

Perhaps she was done being friendly now the meeting was over, you figured.

But after a while, she cautiously broke the silence.

“So… are you ok?” she asked, glancing sideways at you. “Only, I’ve seen you present your work a bunch of times now and I’ve never seen you get all nervous like you were today.”

“I…” you weren’t really sure how to respond. *Were* you ok? You let out a long sigh. “I mean, yeah, sorry, I was feeling… kind of distracted today.”

“By anything in particular?” she asked, and you could tell she was trying to keep her tone casual, but it felt like she was sniffing around for information. Was she going to tell Nora about how you’d gotten flustered in front of Isaac? You knew Abby took her work seriously, but that didn’t seem like the kind of thing she’d do.

You pressed your lips together, thinking of how to respond. You pulled your lower lip into your mouth with your teeth, nibbling anxiously at it while trying to decide what to say.

*Fuck it,* you decided, *let’s just go with the truth.*

“Well, if I’m honest… I got distracted because of you,” you answered as plainly as possible, glancing sideways at her. Her eyes met yours in surprise, but then she rearranged her face into a serious look of concern and returned to look at the road.

“Oh… okay,” she responded, a little tentatively. A silence hung between you, and then: “Is it… about the…?”

“The argument we had? Yeah. Yup,” you responded awkwardly. Things felt uncomfortable all of a sudden.

Neither of you said anything for a moment, both waiting for the other to go first.

“It’s just—” she started.

“I want to—” you began at the same time.

You both laughed, each glancing sheepishly at the other.

“You go first,” you said, trying to be considerate.

She pressed her lips together and took a deep breath, as if steeling herself to say something difficult.

“I’ve… been meaning to say,” and she paused for a long time in which she looked off in the distance thoughtfully. “I’ve been meaning to say that I’m sorry… for how I was that day,” she said, speaking slowly, “and for how I’ve been… since.” She cast another glance towards you, and then back to the road again. “I mean, what you said, it was… it was really *not* cool, but… I’ve been a bit of an asshole to you, and, well, yeah. I’m sorry about that,” she finished.

Hearing her say this just added to the tumult that had been running through your brain all afternoon. You appreciated the nuance she’d put into what she said, but now that she’d said what she said, you feared your own apology would just come across as meaningless; like you were only saying it because she had said it first. You screwed up your face in mix of confusion and frustration.

“*Ugh*, this isn’t how this is meant to go,” you started a bit pathetically. “Abby, *I* feel terrible for what I said to *you*,” you responded miserably, and you meant it even more so now she had just expressed herself with such vulnerability. “I mean, yeah I was frustrated by some of the things you said. But how I responded… it was *beyond* insensitive. I… I just can’t believe I said those things. I feel like *such* an asshole,” and you looked down at your hands in shame as you pulled your lower lip between your teeth again and let out a long, heavy sigh. “I’m so sorry, Abby. I really am,” you finished.

She nodded, and the silence hung between you again for a moment. “Thankyou… for saying that,” she said quietly, “you were *kind of* an asshole,” she added with a grimace, and you winced at the sight of it.

“Ugghhh I really was, wasn’t I?” you cringed, scrunching up your face with embarrassment. You felt you owed her an explanation. “It wasn’t about you, exactly, it was… a thing that happened a while back now. I thought I’d moved past that stuff, but… clearly not, I guess!” you laughed ruefully, your disappointment in yourself apparent.

“Yeah but, I mean… I was… a bit of a dumbass, too,” she admitted. “Like, yeah, I have what I have because of my dad…” her voice trailed off; she clearly didn’t want to finish that sentence, and cleared her throat instead, “but this job—like, yeah, it’s hard work, but it pays stupidly well; like, *disproportionately* stupidly well. I got really lucky really young from a career perspective. And I… I suppose I get so caught up in it that I forget sometimes that maybe others didn’t get as lucky as I did.”

“Abby,” you paused, looking at her earnestly through narrowed eyes, disbelief on your face, “you get that it’s not just luck, right? Like that you’re not just partner at FFL&Y because of luck?”

“What do you…?” she didn’t finish her sentence, merely furrowed her brows and seemed genuinely puzzled.

“Oh Abby. Jesus. I mean, do I *really* have to say it? You’re really fucking smart. Like, you run circles around everybody you work with, and you don’t even seem to break a sweat doing it. You have an answer for every question, and that’s even *despite* the fact that you work with some really, really capable people,” and you could feel yourself blushing now, but you kept going anyway. “You pick up new concepts in, like, five seconds; and you can de-escalate clients as obnoxious as Isaac in a way that just looks so effortless. Do you even *get* how rare it is for one person to be able to *do* all of those things so *well*?” you finished, shaking your head in a good-humoured way at her obliviousness and letting out a small, frustrated huff.

She looked stunned at all of this. Her mouth was moving as though she was trying to find the words to explain all this away, but couldn’t quite grasp them. “I mean, I just… I read a lot and… so much of what I do is just using common sense…” and she mumbled this in a way that made you certain she truly didn’t understand how her seemingly-limitless capabilities made her special in any way. She glanced sideways at your face, and your mouth was now hanging open in pure disbelief. “What..?” and she gave you a genuinely confused look that was so endearing before returning her attention to the road. She was so flushed that her cheeks, neck and even her ears were all red, and you couldn’t help but chuckle at her. She was so smart, and so fucking dumb all at the same time. It was adorable.

You realised in this moment that somehow, you’d both ended up back at that easy place you’d found yourselves weeks before, and you weren’t really sure how it had gone from *awkward-as-hell* to *whatever this was* in the space of a few hours.

And all of a sudden, here was this version of Abby you’d met that first morning when you’d lain safely enclosed in her arms while she’d talked with you about her dad, and about wanting to be seen for more than what most people presumed she was. The Abby who revealed her vulnerabilities with an uncharacteristic uncertainty that you presumed few got to see. The Abby who didn’t want to be contained neatly within *any* box that others wanted to put her into—but didn’t realise that just being who she was meant *no* box could ever contain her.

As you realised all of this, time slowed down just like it had that first night she’d kissed you, and you felt as though your stomach had dropped through the floor of the car—because all of this made your heart ache for her even more. It made you want her so much you felt sick.

And you hated the way you felt as you realised this, because being with her would mean putting your livelihood, and thus your *art*—the thing that drove you, and the one thing in your life that felt like it was wholly for *you*—at risk. But *not* being with her felt impossible, and unimaginable; and all of that was reliant on whether or not she even wanted to be with *you* in return.

And you were sure she probably didn’t. Not after you’d shown her how cruel you could be, even if you hadn’t really meant it.

You swallowed, and could feel that the anxious lump in your throat had returned in earnest.

“Hey, are… you ok?” the sound of Abby’s voice cut through your anxious thoughts.

You blinked and shook your head a few times to bring yourself back to your senses.

“Yeah, I’m just… feeling a bit car sick,” you said with wince, and you supposed it wasn’t even really a lie.

“Should I find somewhere to pull over?” she asked, a tender look of concern on her now-serious face.

“Thanks, but I’ll be ok. We’re nearly back at the office, anyway, right?” and she nodded in reply, eyebrows still furrowed despite your assurances.

You both sat in silence for a while longer, and you occasionally stole a look at her as she concentrated on the traffic. She met your eyes on one occasion, and the corners of her mouth curled in a smile so small you could have easily missed it, but you were thankful you didn’t. You gave her a small smile of your own in return, and a tension in her body seemed to relax just a little at that.

You got back to the office at around 4pm.

As you walked with Abby back towards your desk from the elevators, the sun through the office windows was already starting to fade. Manny had texted her with the details of the tennis tournament on Saturday, and she was complaining to you about how annoying it was that her long weekend at the cabin would be delayed by a day.

“I don’t know why I agree to these things. Manny owes me for this one,” she scoffed, with a laugh and an eye-roll.

“Well, while you two are *strutting* about the tennis court—” you began in jest, but she interrupted you.

“What do you mean, *‘strutting’*?” she protested, looking offended, but you merely snorted derisively in reply, and continued.

“—yes, while you two are *strutting*, I’ll be nestled up enjoying a quiet weekend of woodcarving, away from throngs of country club-types in beige cable knit sweaters cheering over hitting a ball back and forth.” You smiled smugly, looking forward to the peace of your cozy cabin in the mountains.

“Hey!” she reacted in mock outrage, “So firstly, what’s wrong with a cable knit sweater? Though I agree that beige is a bad choice because it gets dirty so easily if you want to do *anything* practical, and navy looks way better, anyway,” and she cocked *that* eyebrow arrogantly. “And secondly, you think I wouldn’t rather be doing the same?” Her expression was a pained one. “I’m only doing this because Manny is *irritatingly* effective at guilting me into this crap,” and you piped up with an *‘Mmmhmm, sure, whatever you say,’* at that. “And thirdly,” and she said this a little more loudly to drown out your sass, “there’s a lot more to tennis than just ‘hitting a ball back and forth,’ by the way. There’s strategy, consistency, execution—” She was being huffy at the fact that someone would downplay athletic competition, and you couldn’t help but find it cute.

“And I’m *very* excited that you and Manny get to enjoy all of… whatever that is together,” you said, cutting in again. “*I*, meanwhile, will be walking amongst the pines, and hoping for the first snowfall,” you interrupted, with a dreamy look on your face, excited to be back in nature again. Your happy place was amongst the trees.

“Hey, you two!” Owen’s head popped out from behind his monitor and broke up your banter. He gave you a cheesy smile and wave that seemed a bit too friendly for 4pm on a Thursday, and you grew suspicious.

Abby narrowed her eyes in Owen’s direction as if trying to figure something out. When his grin turned to a ‘please don’t shoot the messenger’ brand of grimace, Abby’s expression shifted from curious to incensed.

“Oh for fuck’s sake, what does he want *now*?” She rolled her eyes, and grumpily stamped towards Owen’s desk.

“So Isaac said you three did *amazingly* at the meeting, you covered off all his questions and concerns, and he’s very grateful.” Owen was really hamming up the compliments for you both, trying his best to prepare you for the worst. “He made special mention of the effort you’d gone to on the colour palette,” Owen added, addressing you directly, with a beaming look of pride.

“Yeah, yeah, whatever Owen, we were great, we’re always great, get *on* with it. What bullshit does Isaac need us to do?” It was clear from her tone that this was not the first time whatever-this-was had happened.

“Soooooo you know those changes he said he wanted for Tuesday afternoon?”

“Mmm-hmm,” she bristled. Over Abby’s shoulder, you saw Mel making a weird face and putting in her airbuds to block out what you presumed would be Abby’s inevitable reaction to whatever Isaac’s request was.

“Well… uhhh. He needs them… for tomorrow at 8am now,” spat out hurriedly, gritting his teeth and squeezing his eyes shut in preparation for the onslaught.

“Are you for fucking REAL? That fucking… I’m gonna…” and she stepped back with her hands in her pockets, jaw clenched as she looked towards the ceiling trying to contain her rage. “Eight fucking a.m.? Why? *Why* does he need them at 8am?”

“That big investor from Germany had to change his travel plans to this weekend, so Isaac wants to catch him before he flies out. Tomorrow morning was the only time,” he explained as efficiently and as calmly as possible.

She inhaled a seething breath through her nostrils and breathed out, clenching her fists so hard you heard her knuckles crack. It was a little scary and simultaneously, somehow hot? You made a mental note to chat with your therapist about that one.

With glowering eyes and a low voice, she turned to Owen, “Are the requirements—”

“In your email,” he responded quickly, anticipating her request.

“Including his amendments?”

“He said he sent you a photo of some mark-ups he made on a print-out.”

You turned to Abby. “How can we help?” you asked, but before she could say anything, Owen spoke again.

“Uhhh, your design changes need to be done, too, and… the updates to the draft investor doc,” he said quietly, with another nervous grimace.

“What?!” you snapped back, now joining Abby’s rage-fest. “That’s two days worth of changes we spoke about, *plus* the whole investor doc?!” and your own face was contorted in annoyance.

“Yeah, I’m afraid so,” and Owen made a sympathetic face at the both of you. :He sent a prioritised list, and said to get through as many of the Priority 1 items as possible. I’m so sorry, you guys. Mel and I will help however we can. And… and I’ll talk to Nora about getting you Tuesday and Wednesday off in lieu,” he added.

You and Abby both said nothing, just looked at each other in shared frustration, and walked towards your desks to get started.

Despite the initial anger, it turned out to be an oddly-bonding evening for all of you as a team.

You and Mel paired up on the design work. She talked you through all the text changes Isaac had asked for, and proof-read the whole document, making changes directly in the file while you worked on updating the artwork for the process diagrams.

Abby had Owen updating spreadsheets for her, remodelling projections based on new numbers Isaac had sent through on hand-written notes. He also worked withy Mel to take the draft slides you’d all used in your meeting earlier that day and turn them into a nicer-looking investor slide deck using the logos, fonts and colours you shared with them.

At 7pm Owen ordered Thai food, and you all allowed yourselves a fifteen minute dinner break during which Owen shared the many colourful reactions Abby had previously had to other ridiculous Isaac-deadlines, including the time she’d unintentionally destroyed a flatscreen TV whilst wildly gesticulating in a conference room. When you asked why Nora kept allowing a client like Isaac to make demands like this, Mel simply responded that he paid stupidly-high day rates for the privilege of having a team on call, and that it was basically the reason Abby quit last year. Isaac had apparently lost it when he’d found out she’d resigned, but the only way Abby would agree to stay at FFL&Y—*and* keep working for Isaac as a client—was on the condition that Isaac would have a limit of four last-minute requests like this per year, and that the whole project team would be credited with two days off in lieu whenever it happened. It was a ridiculous ask, but Isaac had apparently valued Abby’s skills enough to agree to the terms, and so—there you all sat cramming pad thai into your mouth at 7:15pm ahead of a long night of work.

The cleaners went through at 9pm, and kindly worked around you all while you made your way methodically through the seemingly endless to-do list of Priority 1 changes.

Abby sent Mel and Owen home at 10:30pm when it was clear they’d done as much as they possibly could to help, saying there was no point the two of them sit around watching you both work all night. Owen made a tea for you and a coffee for Abby from the espresso machine in the kitchen before heading off with Mel, and then it was just yourself and Abby left, the clicking of your keyboards and mice the only sounds that echoed through the now-deserted office.

At 11:40, Abby appeared by your desk with a tea cradled carefully between her large hands, setting it down gingerly on your desk. She pulled up an office chair beside you.

“How are you tracking? Nearly there?” she asked, hopefully. Her eyes looked a little tired, but apart from that, she still looked great.

You leaned back in your chair, yawned, and stretched your tired neck from side to side as it emitted a few creaky, audible crackles.

“Yeahhhhh, pretty close I think. I just have to finish the annotations on these diagrams, and then I’m done. Maybe twenty or thirty minutes?” you pondered. “How ‘bout you?”

“I just need to run the final models so I can make the charts for the deck. I reckon… fifteen if it all behaves?” she pressed her eyelids shut and let out a big yawn herself.

“But when does a spreadsheet ever behave, though?” You smiled a cynical, slightly deranged smile. You were so glad you mostly got to avoid spreadsheets in your line of work.

“Exactly,” she smirked with a tired chuckle. “Mind if I have a look?” she asked, gesturing towards your screen.

“Yeah, no, of course,” and you yawned again, covering your mouth with the back of one hand.

She scooted in close to you on the office chair to peer at your monitor, leaning in front of your upper body to take over the mouse and keyboard. You made a modicum of effort to move to the side a little to give her room, but you were so exhausted by now that you didn’t really care how close she was. She looked at her shoulder and then looked at you, as if saying, *‘You cool with this?’.*

Your eyes darted to her shoulder and then back to her face, but the rest of your body remained unmoved. “I give zero fucks right now,” you offered by way of tired explanation, your heavy eyes making slow, disinterested blinks.

She let out a small laugh and allowed her thick bicep to press against your upper arm as she reached over you. You felt the warmth of her skin through cotton her shirt sleeve, and her black skinny necktie—loosened around the now-unfastened top button of her shirt—draped across the edge of your desk as she did so.

She’d rolled up the sleeves of her white business shirt to just below her elbows, and as she panned around the document with the mouse, you silently relished watching the way the muscles in her forearms and hands flexed and tensed as they moved deliberately so she could review your work. She was so close to you that you now that became aware of the trademark pine scent that seemed to accompany her everywhere.

In your exhausted state, you spoke without thinking again. “I forgot how good your fragrance smelled. All piney and earthy and nice.” Your expression was relaxed. You were too tired to care about being embarrassed at this point.

She looked over her muscled shoulder at you and watched you for a moment before giving you a timid smirk and returning her eyes to the screen.

A few minutes later, she leaned back in her chair. “It’s looking great. I don’t know how you do all this,” she gestured to the screen, “and make it look so effortless. But yeah, it looks really polished. Nice work.”

“Thanks,” you responded, feeling a bit sleep-drunk. “Shall we get back to it? Race you to the finish,” you suggested, more as encouragement than anything else as she rolled her chair away from you and stood up.

She paused, contemplative, with her fingertips tented on the surface of your desk. “Sure, how about… first one to finish has to carry the other one’s bag to the basement?”

You snorted. “Abby, that’s the dumbest ‘prize’ ever,” you responded flatly in your sleepy haze.

“Whatever,” she shrugged nonchalantly, “I’m still gonna beat you, though,” and she cocked her head to the side.

“Pfffft, okay, whatever you say,” you scoffed—but you secretly *did* want to win, no matter how stupid the stakes.

Abby wandered back to her office, sat down and started working away at her keyboard. You stretched out your arms, and began finishing off the diagrams.

It didn’t take as long as you’d anticipated, and after a final proof of the document, you packaged up the PDF file—one at print quality, and a compressed version he could send afterwards to the German investor—and emailed them through to Isaac, copying in the rest of the team.

You packed up your laptop, surprised Abby was still at her desk, deeply focused on what she was doing.

As you slung your satchel over your shoulder, you made a loud, exaggerated groan that you knew would carry to her office.

“Oh, my bag is *soooo* heavy! How *ever* will I carry it to my *car*,” you teased loudly, as you strutted towards Abby’s office in a victory walk. You flung your satchel onto the sofa in her office, and noted Abby was moving her mouse around with her eyebrows arranged in a scowl.

“You talk a big game, *Anderson*,” and you said her name dramatically for effect, “but when it comes down to it, I guess you don’t have the goods to deliver,” you said smugly before letting out another massive yawn.

“Shut up,” she drawled, a playful pout on her face, “I just… can’t seem to get this chart to do the thing I want it to,” she said, directing an annoyed expression towards the screen. The twinkling lights of the harbour and the buildings shone dimly through the wall of glass behind her.

You sidled around her large oak desk, dragging your fingertips sleepily across the smooth surface of the oak. When you were standing by her shoulder, arms crossed, you craned your head over hers a bit to look with sleepy eyes at the monitor, watching as she played around with the configuration of a chart.

“What are you trying to do?” you asked, squinting as your pupils adjusted to the bright glare of the screen. The office lighting had gone into power-saving mode an hour or so ago, and neither of you had bothered to go hit the switch to return them to full brightness. The only light in her office came from the mid-century modern desk lamp, and the glow of the screens.

“I’m trying to get this dataset to display in a chart with the right colours, but it’s not even displaying the data on the right axes. I did a bunch of these last week no problem, but I think my brain has finally melted,” she sighed with a weak laugh.

“Which data?” you asked.

“This,” she said, escaping out of the chart preferences to highlighting a selection of cells in the spreadsheet with her mouse.

“Here, let me try,” you said, and you didn’t wait for a reply—you just reached across her arms and pushed her hands away from the keyboard and mouse with your own.

“Do you want these headings, too?” you asked, pointing to the screen.

“Uhhh, yeah, only as a key for the chart, though,” she replied.

“’Kay,” you said, working through the formulas and formatting. “What colour scheme did you want?”

“The accessible one you did for the diagrams. For consistency. Like the thing you said the other day, if we have consistency between the documents and the presentations, it reduces cognitive… weight..?” she said the last word with a bit of uncertainty.

“Cognitive *load*,” you corrected with an impressed little smirk, “consistency creates predictability and reduces dissonance, meaning the user can focus on making sense of the information you’re sharing, rather than being distracted by just trying to read the information *itself*,” you said loftily, as though reading it from one of your design school text books.

“Heh. Yeah, that,” she said sheepishly, and she sounded as exhausted as you felt.

“You know, I didn’t think you were really listening when I said all that stuff,” you remarked with a self-conscious mumble, glancing over your shoulder to look back at her.

“Of *course* I was listening to that stuff,” she replied, as if it was obvious, “I mean, I was pissed as hell at you, but that doesn’t mean I’d ignore what you were *saying*. You know your shit, you’re really good at this, and I still respect you, even if you *were* quite mean,” she teased.

You cringed visibly, and then nodded with a look of appreciation before turning your head back to the screen. You changed a few more of the chart settings and typed the hex numbers for the brand colours into the colour picker.

“Et voilà,” you said with raised eyebrows and a flourish towards the screen. You stepped back from the mouse and keyboard to lean your butt against the edge of her desk, and crossed your ankles smoothly.

“Damn, thankyou. That looks so much better,” she nodded gratefully at your work, surveying the charts. “You even fixed up the fonts,” she remarked, as she proceeded to drop the charts into the presentation deck.

A minute later, she was attaching the finished presentation, and typing out an email to Isaac. You heard her Macbook make a little *swoosh* noise, meaning that the email had sent. Abby made a deep inhale and breathed out a long yawn before reclining back in the leather office chair and interlacing her fingers behind her head. Her broad, muscular arms strained against the fabric of her shirt.

“Thank fuck that’s done,” she breathed out slowly, “Fucking Isaac. He can be such a pain in the ass.”

“Mmhmm,” you hummed sassily in agreement.

“But on the plus side, we *now* get a five day weekend,” she said, closing her eyes and raising her eyebrows in satisfaction.

“Mmmmmhmmmm,” and you hummed contentedly this time, and she laughed at your wordless but nonetheless effective contributions.

She took another deep breath and relaxed further into her chair. After a moment, she opened her eyes and looked off into the distance of the darkened office, mulling something over.

“So… can I ask you something?” she said, a little tentatively, turning her head towards you.

“Mmmmm?” you said cheekily, and you both laughed at how derpy you were being in your exhaustion.

“Dumbass,” she chortled with a smirk. “No, seriously—” and you shifted your features to show her you were listening, “youuuu… said something today. You said… I distracted you. I made you nervous…” her voice trailed off.

“Oh… uhhh, yeah, I… I guess I did… say that,” you replied, looking down at your hands and fidgeting with your fingers a little uncomfortably.

Despite how exhausted you were, your senses sharpened and your breathing shallowed in response to the line of questioning she’d started. You pressed your lips together and looked anywhere *other* than at Abby’s face, which was now inclined in your direction as she studied your features carefully with that unreadable look.

“What… did I do that made you nervous? ” she asked, curious.

You paused, uncertain of how to respond. “I… I’m not sure I should answer that,” you said, avoiding the question, and looking at her with a pained expression.

“Why?” She tilted her head to the side a little.

Your stomach was churning, and your heart was racing now.

“Because… if I…” you took a deep inhale, and made a strained look somewhere in the vicinity of the bookshelf before turning your eyes back to Abby’s, as if silently pleading with her: *Please don’t ask me to answer that. Please*.

You were painfully aware that the anxious lump in your throat had returned, and you tried to gulp it away without success.

You tried to speak, but you couldn’t say it.

She sensed your hesitation and interjected, her features soft as she spoke the words slowly and carefully. “Is it because… if you answer… you’ll have to tell me how you feel… about me?”

She was looking directly in your eyes now, and you were hoping you would just die of embarrassment. Silence hung between you both.

Was she really asking this question? Asking you to bare the truth of what you were feeling before her? Asking you to take this enormous leap off an emotional cliff? Or perhaps she’d noticed you looking at her in the car today; felt you’d lingered a bit too long; wanted you to stop. Could you bare the humiliation of that?

You pressed your lips together, looked down at your feet, and then back to her eyes. Your teeth were biting against your lower lip, making it smart.

She leaned forward in her chair and swivelled it so she was facing you directly, then reached out and gently took your hands into her own. The warmth of her big, soft hands on yours made your breath hitch, and your whole body buzzed in response to the sensation of her touch. You could feel your heart absolutely pounding in your chest with—was it *nervousness; anxiety; hope*? You honestly weren’t really sure. Your feelings were overwhelming you.

She looked up at you and her blue eyes shone in the dim light of the room. You were surprised to realise she looked nervous and awkward herself.

Why was *she* nervous? Your tired mind was struggling to make sense of what was going on.

She swallowed uncomfortably and then spoke. “I… I didn’t tell you earlier, but… there was a sort of—dumb reason that I was being so cold towards you these past few weeks,” and she looked up at your face briefly and then back to where her hands held yours. “You said you didn’t want to start anything with someone you worked with… and after our argument—I mean I was hurt at first, by what you said,” and you felt a pang of guilt in your heart in response to that. “But after a while, I just felt this intense… longing. Like, I’d found something—*someone*—different, the kind of person I never expected to meet.”

She shook her head. *Was she embarrassed?* you wondered. *Why would she be embarrassed?*

She was brilliant, she was charismatic, she was gorgeous.

She was *perfect* to you.

Your head was swimming with thoughts, trying to make sense of what was occurring. *Was this real? Were you misunderstanding?*

“This sounds really stupid, I know,” she continued, a flush appearing on her cheeks, “like, I hook up with someone once and I’m like, smitten or something? It feels like a bad cliché. I swear it’s not usually like this for me,” and she scrunched her eyes up in self-conscious disbelief. “But when we spoke, you said you couldn’t do this, and I understand that, I really do. And I tried really hard *not* to care about you. But I just… didn’t know how to shut out how I felt… how I *feel*,” and as she said this last word, she looked right at you.

“How you… *feel*, like, present tense?” you said, trying to force your tired brain to comprehend.

“Yeah,” she said simply, “how I *feel*,” and she swallowed. “And so I just… I closed myself off. I didn’t know how to deal, and just kind of freaked out, I guess. Like, everyone thinks I have all the answers. And it’s mostly true, at least for some things. I’m *fine* at dealing with all the work stuff, and the practical life stuff, and I’m usually *fine* with hookups, too, but this… I’ve never felt like this before,” and she clenched her jaw uncomfortably as she admitted this to you. “Look, I *know* I can’t promise things will be easy, and I get how important your work and your art is to you, and I definitely *don’t* want to get in the way of either of those things. But I just… I suppose… I had to tell you how I feel. About *you.* I *really* like you. Like, a *lot*. And—only if you want to as well, of course—but… I’d like to see if we can figure out how we could make this work. You and I.” She looked at your entwined hands, and then back to your face, searching your eyes for some sign of how you might be feeling.

You stood there, face blank, blinking stupidly in a state of shock. You weren’t sure how to respond. You could feel the warmth of her hands around yours, and the comforting sensation of her thumbs brushing tenderly against your fingers.

“Is this too much? Have I overstepped?” she asked, and she said it with such sincerity that it somehow floored you even further. “We can stop talking about this. Like, we can just go our separate ways if that’s what you want. I’ll move on, and… and we’ll just be colleagues, or whatever. I don’t want you to feel pressured. But I didn’t want to regret not saying it. I hope you understand.”

It was so strange seeing Abby like this. She was normally so composed; so unflappable. But in this moment, she was floundering; trying so hard to do the right thing by you, over-explaining things, being careful not to overstep while being honest about how she really felt.

As you stood there surveying her face, her eyes, her crinkled brow—you realised you’d been fighting for weeks against what you’d been feeling. You’d been so focused on making the *smart* choice for your work and your art. Those things mattered, of course; they mattered so much to you.

But so did *this*.

All of a sudden, it felt so clear to you: Abby *mattered* to you.

If there’s anything you’d learned from the chaotic bullshit that was The Doctor, and all the failed hookups and relationships that came before her, it was that finding someone like Abby was rare: someone who was willing to *think* about their feelings, and own up to their bullshit; someone who was courageous enough to be vulnerable and honest, even if it was hard, or if it might embarrass them; someone who spoke up for what they believed in, whether in work, or in life—which was something Abby had now done *twice* in the space of a day; someone who was willing to walk away if it was the right thing to do; all of those things were rare *in and of themselves*.

But to find one person who possessed *all* these qualities?

Well, that was even *rarer*.

Abby looked at you as you stood before her, trying to figure out what to do next.

“Are you… ok?” she asked after some time, her voice filled with the same concern you’d sensed in the car earlier that day. She wasn’t being pushy, or trying to pry; it was genuine care for you.

“Maybe you need some time to think about things. It’s ok if you do,” she suggested, an earnest look in her eyes.

“Abby,” you started, your face serious, “I *don’t* need to think about this anymore,” you said, pulling your hands away from hers.

“Oh, um… okay, sure. I understand,” she responded, nodding forlornly. “I get it, I’ll just—” and she started to pull backwards from you as she spoke.

“No! Abby, will you just—” and you eased off your perch on the edge of her desk and moved towards her as your hands came to cup either side of her face.

Her expression changed. She looked up at you, blue eyes wide. She was still seated in the chair before you, and as she realised what you meant, her hands moved slowly, carefully, to your hips to tug you a little closer. You nestled your legs in between her knees, and your mouth curved into a tiny, satisfied smile at being properly close to the warmth of her body again for the first time in weeks.

“Are you sure you want this?” she asked, her voice low, and she was searching your eyes, making certain there was no hesitation in them.

You nodded, leaning towards her to press your forehead against hers, and you both closed your eyes. In the silence of the empty office floor, the only sounds you could hear now were those of your heavy breathing.

“Yes, I’m sure,” and your voice was steady. “If I’m honest, Abby, I think I’ve known I wanted you since that first morning in your arms,” you said, and you felt a low swoop in your stomach that made you realise how much you’d been holding back your need for her. Your eyes met, and you could see the relief in her expression in response to the sincerity of your words. “I’ve been fighting it so hard, trying to convince myself that what I’m feeling isn’t real. But I just… I don’t want to anymore. I *want* you, I wanna *be with* you,” and she nodded her head slowly in shared understanding.

You pulled your head back from hers just a little, one hand softly caressing the line of her defined jaw while the other threaded into her blonde hair, fingertips gently scraping against her scalp. The smell of pine washed over you again.

She closed her eyes, taking in the sensations of you as her hands moved to the small of your back, and she let out a big exhale of hot air that brushed against your face.

“I missed the feeling of your hands on me,” she whispered, eyelids dropping low as her brows softened at your touch.

“I missed having my hands on you,” you breathed in reply, your face creeping closer and closer to hers.

She tilted her head back ever so slightly, her blonde eyelashes catching the light of the desk lamp as her lips brushed lightly against yours.

<h3>Chapter End Notes</h3>
<p>Phew, well that was a rather epic 12k words wasn't it, my fellow thirsty Abby stans!
This chapter turned out completely differently from my ### Chapter Notes. I started writing it per the notes and it just felt a bit too contrived and fantastical (and not a good way). I'm trying really hard to follow where the character development is taking me and be ok with the wild directions this takes us all in!
I shall now disappear into my smut cave and see you all soon with the next chapter. Hang tight, my pretties!
Keep the comments coming, too: I appreciate every single one of them, and they've really kept me on track in this angst-filled time for our poor Reader!</p>

<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>Those pillowy-soft lips formed into a sulky pout and she looked up at you from her perch at the edge of the chair, exasperated—but obediently awaiting your next instruction.
'Fuck, well this is genuine delight', you thought, exceedingly pleased with yourself.
You would honestly not have minded if Abby had, in fact, completely ignored your offer; had torn off your clothes and railed you for the remainder of the evening atop that beautiful oaken desk, leaving smears of your release as battle scars across it’s surface.
Getting Abby Anderson to submit, though? That was something you knew wouldn’t happen with any kind of regularity, so you’d take advantage while you had the chance.
--
You're alone with Abby in her darkened office, and you've both finally gotten your shit together to communicate that you're head-over-heels for one another. You're desperate for her to fuck you, but after pining after her for weeks, you decide to make her suffer juuuuust a little bit before you let her have her way with you, and surprisingly—she lets you.</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>My brain, about four weeks ago: Ok, we’ve got a heap of work to do this weekend for the class I have to start teaching next week.
Also my brain: Here, I got you this steaming bucket of thirsty content for your writing inspiration that you’ve been trying to channel for the last several weeks. I’ve refused to be forthcoming with it til now—but HERE YOU GO!
My brain, two weeks later: Ok! Things are a little less hectic now, let’s GOOOOOO!
Also my brain: Nahhhhh, now’s not a good time for us, we can only write for maybe 30 minutes a day, every 2-3 days at most?
My brain: 🫠
-----
So yeah, that's the kind of month or so it's been! Work has been hectic-as, and I've not had writer's block per se, because the story's been THERE in my head ready to go—but it's been more like "My brain is so exhausted that I can hardly sit down and concentrate for long enough to get back into flow" so I've had to take quite a few breaks along the way to get this done. It's been frustrating, because about two weeks ago, after finally realising where I wanted to take this chapter to keep it authentic to the characters, I just had absolutely no mental energy to sit down and turn those ideas into actual words on an actual screen. Buuuut it's important to me that I'm in the right headspace when writing, or else it's just really challenging to get the right tension and vibe I'm wanting from these two. They have such fun chemistry, and whilst I'm anti-perfectionist, I'm pretty dedicated to create characters that feel consistent and believable.
Anyway, after a few weeks of intermittent little spurts of writing every few days whenever I could manage an hour or so, WE ARE FINALLY HERE, PEOPLE! Our beloved Abby and reader are reuniting in some truly hot-and-heavy, thirsty AF, sexy sex times at the office. You asked, I've delivered.
As seems to happen with my smut of late, I hit an insanely high word count as I was having so much fun tormenting our dear Abby at the hands of our reader. There will be more to come from this late night at the office, but for now, this should tide all you thirsty babes over for a little while at least.
Have fun, and as always—leave me a comment and tell me what you think!

</aside>

Abby’s blue eyes looked up at you from where she sat in her black leather office chair. You were positioned between her splayed legs, her hands resting against the small of your back and your faces barely inches apart from one another. One of your hands rubbed gently against her jawline, while the fingers of your other hand nudged into the messy blonde hair at the nape of her neck. The sounds of your heavy breaths punctuated the otherwise-silent office.

In the weeks since you’d first kissed her, you’d wondered at times if you’d possibly exaggerated in your memory the softness of Abby’s lips; or how good her pine-scented fragrance smelled with your mouth against her neck; or that when her fingers pressed against the skin of your lower back, they seemed to anchor you firmly in the present moment so that it felt like all there was was you and Abby.

Perhaps, consumed with longing—and with your fingers pressed against the heat of your core late at night in bed—your mind had remembered that first night with her with too great a level of enthusiasm; that she wasn’t, in fact, this perfectly-muscled being that wielded her overwhelming strength with considered precision against your body; hadn’t possessed the ability to make your knees want to buckle beneath you when her tongue teased against your own at the threshold of your where your lips met as you kissed.

But in the darkness of her office, head swimming with your desire for her, Abby’s mouth met yours, and as you felt the pillowy fullness of her lower lip graze across your own, you knew for certain you hadn’t imagined any of it. Even with only the smallest amount of contact, she ignited a fire within you that was incomparable to anything you’d experienced prior.

You drew a ragged breath and let it release shakily from your body as your mouths sought one another out in the dim light of the room.

“Well, this isn’t *quite* how I expected today to go,” you admitted quietly between kisses, a bashful smile revealing itself to her. Your hunger for one another’s mouths was interspersed with messy kisses to each other’s cheeks; jawlines; necks; earlobes.

She raised that eyebrow in a way that was so sexy it made your heart lurch. “Hm—neither,” she responded simply in a gravelly voice, a satisfied smirk forming at the corner of her mouth.

She was lightly nipping her teeth against your lips, deliberately teasing you, depriving you of her mouth and tongue. Your breaths were punctuated by pants and hitches that betrayed how desperate you were for her.

“So *eager*,” she purred, her cockiness having seemingly returned in earnest. You rolled your eyes, but her smirk only broadened into a smug grin. “I guess I’m basically irresistible,” she offered, looking up at your face with a nonchalant shrug that was accompanied by a firm squeeze of your butt cheek with one of her enormous hands.

“Pfft, you’re incorrigible,” you snickered, but at the feel of her kneading the flesh of your ass, your hips bucked forward involuntarily, and she smiled even more broadly.

“You love it,” she offered simply with another hitch of the eyebrow, as she pulled a little too roughly against your lower lip with her teeth, rousing a delicious flash of pain and an accompanying moan.

And she was right, because you really, truly *did* love it. You had been craving her, pining for her, this entire time she’d been avoiding you—no matter how hard you’d tried to repress it.

Your fingers were threaded in Abby’s hair—which was now significantly messier than it had been ten minutes earlier—dragging against her scalp with your fingernails in a way that made her upper lip curl, and eliciting small grunts of pleasure from deep within her throat that seemed to travel straight to your cunt.

In response, those large, strong hands pulled you even closer to the heat of her body as you towered over her, her face angled upwards towards yours from her position in her chair.

Her teeth bit a little more sharply against your lower lip, pulling it towards her briefly before releasing.

A sharp hiss escaped from between your teeth. “Fuckkkk, Abby—” you moaned shakily in reply, your eyes finding her own, which were dark with her desire for you.

One of your hands meandered its way from where it caressed her jaw down to her neck, then against the crisp white collar of her shirt, before it located her necktie: it was loosely fastened just beneath the vee of her unbuttoned shirt collar.

You pulled your face back from hers just slightly, taunting her with heavy-lidded, lust-filled eyes and hovering your lips just a few millimetres out of reach.

When she eagerly lunged upwards with her body to seek out your lips again, you tugged firmly on the tie as your mouth curled at the edges.

You gently bit your lip at the sight of her so desperately seeking you out. Her narrowed eyes met your own: you could see flashes of both shock *and* arousal within them. Abby curled her hands over the frontmost edge of the arms of the chair, as if to gain purchase for her next attempt.

A few seconds, and then—she tried lurching upwards once more; but you yanked more firmly against the necktie this time, pulling her downwards into submission before allowing your lips to hover mere inches above her own so that the hot air from both your lips mingled together.

When she lurched upwards a final time, you were even quicker at restraining her in her place: she barely got her ass out of the seat before you pulled sharply downwards, and leaned further over her in a playful display of dominance.

Abby’s fingers flexed visibly in frustration against the arms of the chair. She cocked her eyebrow at you, a delicious look on her face.

You knew she probably wasn’t trying *all* that hard, because if she had been, there would’ve been nothing a mere necktie could do to stop her—but you enjoyed that she was playing along with this little game nonetheless.

“You know I could overpower you in a heartbeat, right?” she drawled, voice barely above a whisper, her neck and shoulders straining just slightly against the firm grip you held around her necktie. Her eyes bore into yours with a relaxed arrogance that was *completely* infuriating, but *oh so* fucking hot.

“Obviously,” you replied with a roll of your eyes, “but—you’re not going to,” you finished as steadily and as firmly as you could muster. You lowered your head towards hers and slowly dragged your lower lip with aching softness against the skin immediately adjacent to her mouth.

Her eyelids lowered in response, and she let out a ragged puff of air and licked her lips.

“Oh really,” she breathed, and her voice was soft, but her reply was shaky and there was a little uncertainty there. “And… what makes you think I’d comply with *that* expectation?” she asked, a hint of a challenge in her tone.

Her eyes stared darkly into yours, and you could see something behind them that wasn’t *menacing*, per se—but more like a barely-contained hunger; as if her self-restraint was only *just* winning out over her desire to pounce on you and mark your body with scorching kisses and the power of her hands. She watched your face, lips parted, waiting. An electric tension thrummed invisibly between you both.

“Because, Abby, if you don’t sit there quietly and keep your hands to yourself, I won’t let you fuck me *later*,” you responded simply with a small shrug.

Abby looked taken aback, arrogant smile completely evaporated, and replaced by an earnest look of confusion. “Wha… that’s not,” she gulped, shaking her head in disbelief. “That’s… completely *unfair*,” she protested, and she sounded almost offended. “Besides,” she composed herself and continued in a silky voice, “I *know* you want me to fuck you.”

She narrowed her eyes salaciously and her voice dropped to barely a whisper, “You *want* me to bend you over this desk and fill you up with my fingers until you scream my name,” she smirked with that arrogant, self-assured confidence that looked so fucking sexy it nearly broke your resolve.

For effect, she slowly and very obviously drummed the fingers of her right hand against the armrest, glancing down at her hand briefly and then back to your gaze.

For the briefest of moments, you hesitated, because *hot damn* the idea of being fucked by those hands—right *here*, right *now*—sounded *so* fucking appetising.

*Hold fast!* A determined voice from somewhere within steeled you.

Abby had made you writhe in agony for weeks.

For a *look*.

For a *conversation*.

For *anything*.

And all the while you had been dreaming of those fingers inside you, and her mouth on your clit, and her hand grasping against the flesh of your ass.

But that wasn’t the **only** thing you’d been dreaming about: flashes of her chiseled thighs either side of you; your mouth buried in her apex as you sucked and laved against her delicate nub; your fingers crooked against the walls of her cunt as sweat trickled from her brow.

You wanted to have *her*, too.

A little bit of suffering was a small price for her to pay in return for those weeks of torment.

Yes, Abby could wait a *little* bit longer, you resolved.

And with that—you let out a slow breath, and broadened your nonchalant smile confidently like you’d not a care in the world.

“I mean, I *suppose* you could test out that idea and see where we end up,” you offered, “seems *awfully* risky, though, when it means you *might* not get to touch me at *all.*”

You weren’t sure where the hell all this bravado had appeared from, but you’d be *damned* if you weren’t going to enjoy the ride. After all—how often did one get the upper hand with ***the*** Abby Anderson?

You looked at her with a deadpanned expression. Your eyes were daring her to try you.

Abby faltered, eyes darting, searching your face as she attempted to logic her way around the situation. Her mouth gaped a few times, as if she was trying to find the right retort, but was coming up short.

“Here’s *my* suggestion,” and you let go of her tie, pressed your hand against flat against her sternum, and bent down so you were looking at her front-on. “How about *you* be good for *me*, hmm? Why don’t you just *relax* in that chair of yours and keep your hands where I can see them— or you’ll find out just *how* unfair I can be,” you finished coolly.

Abby gulped, and screwed up her face in annoyance, eyebrows furrowed as if this was the dumbest idea she’d ever heard.

“So unfair,” she muttered under her breath with a roll of her eyes. She looked your body up and down with want as if the deprivation might kill her.

But then—those pillowy-soft lips formed into a sulky pout and she looked up at you from her perch at the edge of the chair, exasperated—but obediently awaiting your next instruction.

*Fuck, well this is a genuine delight,* you thought, exceedingly pleased with yourself.

You would honestly *not* have minded if Abby *had,* in fact, completely ignored your offer; had torn off your clothes and railed you for the remainder of the evening atop that beautiful oaken desk, leaving smears of your release as battle scars across it’s surface.

Getting Abby Anderson to submit, though? That was something you *knew* wouldn’t happen with any kind of regularity, so you’d take advantage while you had the chance.

You gave her necktie a few gentle tugs so that she would relax her posture, and when she did, you pushed her firmly with one hand into the cushioned leather of the chair. She draped her arms along the length of the armrests with her fingers curled tensely over the ends.

“There, that wasn’t so hard, was it,” you said, patronisingly.

She glowered back at you, but when you hitched one knee onto the seat on the outside her left thigh, and wedged your other leg so it was standing between her own, her expression softened to a smoulder.

You took a moment to take in the sight of her submitting—or at least, Abby’s version of submitting—before you. You noticed how the fabric of her navy trousers strained against the bulk of her thighs, and allowed your eyes to linger on her crotch.

Goddamn. You were desperate to see those thick thighs again, ideally naked and positioned either side of your face.

At the thought of this, you squeezed your eyes shut tightly and made a sharp inhale. The image of her in your mind, towered over you with your mouth on her sex, was overwhelming.

“You okay, baby?” she inquired, a mild look of concern on her face. The pet name made your heart lurch in your chest.

“Mmmhmm,” you composed yourself, speaking slowly. “Just feeling a little flushed thinking about all the things I’d love to do to you.”

Abby raised one eyebrow at you, and looked pleased.

“Yeah? You like thinking about fucking me, huh?” and her voice was so low and gravelly you could barely hear it. Her head relaxed back into the cushion of the chair, while her eyes—so narrowed at this point they were barely slits—bore straight into yours.

She looked so damned sexy that you could hardly believe this was real.

“Why don’t you tell me?” she purred, and bit her lip in anticipation.

You swallowed at the challenge. Abby, meanwhile, snaked a hand around the back of the leg you’d propped up next to hers.

“Hands!” you chided sternly, and the rogue actor slunk back to its position on the armrest as she gave you another sulky pout.

“As I was *about* to say,” you started slowly, “I was thinking about how fucking gorgeous you’d look with your thighs either side of my face while I devour you with my mouth,” and her eyes widened in shock and and then desire at your words. “But I’d like to dismantle you in different ways for now—assuming that’s ok with *you*, of course?” and your hand disappeared behind the nape of her neck as you leaned in to plant soft kisses on her cheeks and jaw.

“I *suppose* I could allow it,” she replied in a resigned drawl.

“So generous of you,” you grinned, your lips dusting kisses across her skin as they inched closer to hers.

“Mmm, I am, aren’t I?” she offered with an air of superiority that made you smirk.

Your lips brushed against Abby’s, tongue dashing against her upper lip, and then your mouths were on each other. The tension between you—the tenuous restraint you’d both been barely maintaining—released, and you were all lips and tongues and wet kisses. Your hands pressed against Abby’s chest and neck, nails raking against skin as you devoured each other hungrily.

As her tongue slid against your own, you felt a hand against your thigh moved upwards towards the cleft of your butt cheek, fingers edging closer towards your cunt, as her other hand slipped up under the hem of your shirt.

You pulled back, immediately grabbing her wrists and pulling her hands off your body.

“Abby,” you said, reprimanding her with your eyes, “do we need to stop?” and you dramatically started pulling your body away from her.

Her eyes looked panicked. “No, I—that’s—you—” she let out a frustrated sigh and cleared her throat.

“I’ll… be good,” she relinquished, hands returning to grasp the armrests, eyes pining for your affections.

You looked sweetly back at her and she pouted again.

“Damn, you know how gorgeous it is when you pout, don’t you?” you asked.

She furrowed her eyebrows in irritation, and it was undeniably adorable watching her respond to the lack of control.

“Hey, you made *me* wait—now it’s *your* turn,” you said, waggling your own eyebrows at her.

“Pffft…” she hissed in reply, but a tiny, shy smile crept into one corner of her mouth.

You leaned closer towards her again to kiss her mouth and then her neck, while your hands found the smooth black fabric of her skinny necktie, loosening and then discarding it on the floor.

She moaned in response, seeking out your mouth to kiss you more intently, teeth dragging against your lips and tongue, eliciting flashes of pain that made your mouth water.

Your hands, meanwhile worked the buttons of her business shirt, revealing a white sports bra underneath. You pulled your mouth away from hers, and yanked the bottom of her shirt free of her trousers. You could see the wide elastic of her boxers peeking out above the waistband of her navy trousers, and the position she was sitting in meant her abs were tensed, each defined in sharp relief.

You were practically salivating.

You pulled back to admire the view, feasting your eyes upon the chiseled lines of her torso. Her eyes followed yours down and then up again, and when you looked back at her with a completely thirsty look on your face, she smiled wickedly.

*How is she this fucking hot*, you thought to yourself, as you pulled your lower lip between your teeth hungrily. She was a sight to behold.

Keeping your eyes on hers, you bent forward again, and slid the flat of your palm down the ridges of her abdomen as she inhaled deeply.

You allowed your fingertips to slide just under the thick, black waistband of her boxers, inching with painful slowness towards her heat. Her mouth fell open, an almost pained expression on her face.

Your fingertips reached the hair just north of her cunt and lingered there, making her wait.

Abby’s eyes bore hotly into yours, and her jaw slackened further in anticipation. Her breathing was shallow and rapid.

You looked back at her lasciviously, relishing in how desperate she was for you to touch her. You pressed your fingers into the soft flesh there, but when they failed to move lower, her eyebrows furrowed in a look that was almost pleading.

“Everything okay, Abs?” you asked teasingly.

She pouted back at you and a tiny whine escaped her throat. You responded by moving the thumb of your other hand to rest against her full lower lip. With her eyes still fixed on yours in a serious sort of scowl, she drew the tip of your thumb between her teeth, and you let out a small, breathy sigh.

You watched as she pulled the digit into her mouth, and you felt her hot tongue swipe against it, teeth grazing immediately thereafter.

“Fuck…” you sighed.

You wrested your thumb slowly from between her teeth, and trailed the now-wet pad of it down her chin. She closed her eyes at the sensation as you pulled your thumb over the crest of her jawline and slowly down her neck. Her head fell back, eyes closed as she embraced the sensation, and tilted her hips towards the hand that rested atop her pubic bone.

“So *needy*, Abby,” you observed quietly, and she scowled again. “Don’t worry, I’ll reward your patience soon. You’re being so good for me,” and when you leaned in to the crook of her neck to nip and lave at her earlobe, she groaned so loudly you could feel it reverberating in your body.

You pulled back, and the hand against her sternum wended its way beneath the fabric of her sports bra. Her hips bucked against you.

Abby started down, open-mouthed, watching as your hands work at her chest.

Her eyes scrunched up in pleasure when you finally palmed the flesh there between your thumb and fingers. When your index and middle fingers squeezed a pebbled nipple between them, she hissed sharply and then groaned. You soothed her peak softly with the pads of your fingertips, before pulling sharply against the metal of the barbell that pierced her nipple.

She exhaled in response to the flash of pain. “*Fuck*! You’re making me so fucking wet.” Her eyes stared hotly into yours as her hips canted uncontrollably upwards once more, causing the fingers that were lightly resting against her pubic bone to slide a little lower towards the apex of her cunt. Your own core twitched as you thought of the wetness between her legs, recalling the silkiness of her, the sweet, salty smell and taste of her arousal.

You rolled her nipple between your fingertips again, pressing the pebbled nub hard against the barbell this time, and she drew a sharp hiss through clenched teeth and groaned gutturally.

“Holy fucking shit, *yeahhhh*,” she panted, eyes clenched in ecstasy and mouth agape.

Watching her losing control under the ministrations of your hands was making *you* more aroused as well. You bit your lip, relishing as you observed Abby’s composure disintegrating before your eyes.

Her chest rose and fell rapidly as her hands tightly gripped the arms of the chair, the muscles in her hands and forearms flexing with barely-constrained power. The veins on the back of her hands were swollen, and a few tiny beads of sweat were visible on her forehead.

You moved your hand to her other breast, and rolled the nipple there between your thumb and forefinger, too, pinching the flesh sharply against the barbell before pulling away with a rough tug.

“Hnnngh,” she panted.

“Mmmm, you like that, huh? So big and strong, but one little squeeze and you’re a complete mess under my hands. So desperate for me to touch you, aren’t you?” you whispered darkly. As you said it, you pinched harder at the nipple, pulling another breathy pant from her.

Even when Abby was on the receiving end, submitting to your touch—there was a raw energy in her that was thrilling. It was like at any moment, she could break loose and spill over with an unbridled power that was capable of inflict all kinds of pleasure and pain on your body.

You licked your lips, and leaned in to lick your way down from her neck to her chest with the back of your tongue. She tasted everso slightly salty.

You hooked your thumb over the cup of her sports bra, leading the way so your mouth could work at the flesh there. In no time, you’d pulled her nipple into your mouth, softly caressing the hard nub with your tongue, intermittently grazing it with your teeth. Abby’s soft pants and grunts and hisses were like poetry in your ear, guiding your mouth as you applied various pressure and sensations to coax her arousal out of her. Meanwhile, your fingers beneath her boxers smoothed gently atop the skin and hair just shy of her heat.

You withdrew your mouth from her nipple, pulling roughly against the ball of one end of the barbell with your teeth before letting go. Abby groaned loudly.

“*Fuck*—you’re fucking—*teasing* me so much. Not fair…” she stammered out, shaking her head, chest heaving, a frustrated expression on her face.

“Hm, you’re so hot and bothered, Abby. What’s wrong? You need something?” you asked sweetly, laying it on thick. You bit your lip, eyeing her mischievously, daring her to to ask for what she wanted. You dug the fingers of your free hand into her hair, dragging your nails against her scalp just slightly, while the fingers against her pelvis crept ever so slightly further south, moving so carefully you were barely touching her.

“Hngh,” she grunted, but she only gritted her teeth, eyes scrunched tightly as you teased your index and middle fingers lower, edging them softly towards the flesh either side of her slit.

“What do you *need*, Abs?” you asked again. Your voice was dangerously soft. Your fingers entwined with her hair, and you pushed her head back with just a little roughness into the cushioned leather of the chair.

At this small display of dominance, her eyes opened and she looked straight at you, face wracked with anguish. The look on her face was intense, pleading.

But you were determined to make her beg.

“I said, what do you *need*?” you asked again more insistently, eyes dark, and the pleasure in your eyes mingled wickedly with a hint of power.

Abby bit her lip, eyebrows knitted in desperation. You looked back at her calmly, a tiny smile at the corners of your mouth, waiting patiently for her to respond.

You heard her fingertips strain audibly against the surface of the armrests, the tension in her body evident as her much-laboured breaths continued. You scraped your fingernails against her scalp and then knotted her hair between your knuckles, tugging it just a little.

Abby looked as though she was about to fall apart, and it was making you so aroused. You could feel the undeniable dampness between your own thighs, and you were holding back your desire to move your hand lower and fuck her into oblivion.

But you waited.

In return for your patience—she let out the smallest sound.

“Please,” she pleaded.

She looked so pathetic at this point, and you could hardly believe you had made Abby fucking Anderson beg. But you wanted to drag out her torment—and ultimately, her pleasure—just a little longer, so you stroked your fingers more deliberately against her labia, careful to avoid the wetness you just *knew* was pooled between.

“Please, *what*?” you asked, annunciating your words with sharp precision. Your eyes were nothing more than slits now, the nefarious grin curled more obviously at the corners of your mouth. You removed your other hand from her hair so you could brace yourself against the back of the chair for what was about to happen.

“Fuck,” Abby panted. She shook her head ever so slightly in the disbelief that you’d brought her to this—and so, you crept your fingertips even closer towards the heat of her centre, deliberately withholding, while encouraging her to give in.

You could feel her hips canting slightly towards your fingers. She panted. You merely raised an eyebrow at her.

She pressed her lips together firmly, and looked away briefly, a pained expression on her face, before turning back to face you.

“Please—please fuck me. I need you, need to feel you inside me,” she breathed out, her mouth hanging open in anticipation.

And so you relented—but just a little.

You nodded your head to show your appreciation of her *kind* request, and allowed your fingertips to dip slightly lower, meeting at the line of her cunt. You didn’t have much room to manoeuvre beneath the relatively taught fabric of her trousers, but you figured that could only add to all the sexual frustration that had been building within her.

When you allowed your fingers to sink between her folds, Abby let out the smallest, neediest whine from the back of her throat.

Your mouth fell open when you realised just how wet she *truly* was.

“Oh, *fuck*, Abby,” you groaned in complete disbelief. She was so goddamned wet that your fingers slid effortlessly between her labia. Her cunt was absolutely soaked. You leaned forward so your mouth was immediately next to her right ear, “Abby—you feel *incredible*\*\*,\*\*” you purred, voice barely above a whisper as you slowly dragged your fingers along the length of her, brushing against her swollen clit whenever you reached her apex. “I can’t believe how *wet* you are for me. You’re practically dripping. Such a good girl,” you finished, biting your lower lip.

“Hnnnngh!” She let out another soft groan, but this one was slower, more drawn out. She sighed, shoulders and chest swelling forward slightly in pleasure, allowing her head to fall back against the chair back.

You took the opportunity to latch onto her neck with your mouth, teeth scraping against the skin, devouring her while your fingers moved slowly, deliberately, gently between her wet folds. You were working her slowly, drawing out her pleasure as much as you possibly could—and every other stroke, you would allow your middle finger to tease deliberately at her entrance. The slickness pooled there was almost irresistible.

“Damn, I absolutely *cannot* wait to fuck you, gonna feel so good,” you purred directly into her ear.

She let out a pained groan in reply, her voice much deeper and all gravelly.

“You’d like that, huh? Want me to fill you up with my fingers?” you continued as you began to rub small circles around her clit, causing her hips to buck towards your hand. “Want me to fuck you hard? Press my fingers against the wall of your cunt and make you come all over my hand?”

She nodded urgently, eyes silently begging you.

“I’m *so* sorry,” you toyed with her, “but I can’t *hear* you. What was it you wanted?” Your eyes met hers with a wicked expression.

“*Fuck*,” she whined in frustration, giving her head a small shake of irritation, but there was a tiny smile at the corner of her mouth. “I’m gonna make you suffer *so much* for this later,” she remarked through hot, heavy breaths as you worked your fingers harder against her clit.

You moved your head back so you could meet her eyes properly, and simply cocked your head to the side and shrugged. “Sure, if you want to. But Abby,” and you paused for dramatic effect, looking directly at her, “right now, you’re gonna have to *tell* me what it is you want, or how could I *possibly* know?” you finished, giving her clit a firmer swipe with your fingers momentarily to torment her further.

She huffed in your direction, so you teased against her wet opening, edging the tips of your fingers just slightly inside, and then withdrawing them. She shuddered against you, and the look on her face was so hot and needy, like she was about to break.

“Fuck… please—fuck me. Need to feel you inside me,” she panted desperately.

You made a small nod, removing your hands abruptly from the heat of her core, and withdrawing your hands from her boxers. You dragged your fingers, coated in her slick, over your tongue, relishing in the salty sweetness of her.

Abby looked at you, scandalised, as though you’d betrayed her.

You smirked, letting out a silent chuckle, and moved your hand to tenderly cup her jaw.

“You’re *so* impatient,” you said softly, dragging your fingertips against her lips so she could taste herself on you, “I’m just gonna make this a little easier for both of us,” and your other hand began unfastening her belt.

Her frown softened as she watched your hand at work, and she licked her lips in anticipation and let out a soft hum. You removed the knee from the chair and positioned your body between her legs so she could spread them wider for you. Her breathing was ragged. She waited, looking at you, desperate for relief.

Your hand crept beneath her boxers again, and then your fingers were moving slowly back and forth through her slick folds. She closed her eyes at the sensation of your fingers gradually working their way down towards the heat of her core.

The tip of one of your fingers teased at her cunt, and you moved your face closer to hers so that your mouths were only inches apart.

“Abby,” you breathed out her name, more a command than a question, but your tone was soft.

Abby looked at you, her eyes deep pools of blue in the dim light and mouth open with want, as you held her gaze, determined to watch her come apart at your hands.

You eased a single finger inside her slowly, and a low drawn-out groan escaped her mouth. The sound made your head swim.

“Ohhhh fuck,” you sighed out, eyelids fluttering and your own cunt twitching in satisfaction at the sensation of her around you, “you feel so fucking good, Abby.”

You pulled out, locking eyes with her again before fucking your finger deeper into her, and you were rewarded with another groan, longer this time.

“Another?” you asked, and she nodded.

When you added a second finger, her cunt clenched tightly around you in response. She was panting as you gradually increased the pace of your thrusts.

“Ohhhhh fuck yeah, feels amazing,” she crooned, narrowed eyes staring at you in the darkness.

“Mmm, you feel so good, Abs,” and you looked down to watch your fingers disappearing inside of her over and over, her arousal coating the base of your fingers.

Glancing up to admire the rest of her body, you saw that the finely-etched muscles of her abdomen—which were framed on either side by the crisp, white cotton of her business shirt—were taught, the skin there glistening with a light sheen of sweat. There was an obvious patch of sweat on her sports bra between her breasts, too, and her freckled chest, neck and cheeks were flushed pink while her mouth hung open, letting out ragged breaths. Her eyes were screwed up in pleasure, eyebrows crinkled, and an errant bead of sweat was running from her hairline down her temple, wisps of blonde hair plastered to her forehead.

She looked completely gorgeous, lost in the gratification being administered by your hands.

“Fuck, you look so damned sexy getting fucked by me,” you snarled in satisfaction, your cheeks hot and mouth agape as you watched the expressions on her face.

Abby’s lip curled in satisfaction, eyes opening to look at you as her eyebrow hitched up to eye you with lust. “Fucking—*yeah*,” she said between heavy breaths, “you make me so fucking wet,” and at that moment, you felt the walls of her cunt squeeze tighter around your fingers as you thrust in and out of her. “Keep fucking me, just like that,” she choked out in a low voice in between breathy pants.

You leaned in closer to her, bracing your elbow against the back of the chair for leverage so you could get *just* the right angle to press your fingers against the sensitive spot deeper inside her. At this, she sought out your mouth with her own, hungrily devouring your tongue, and you returned in kind with bites and nips against her tender flesh while she moaned into you.

“More,” she urged, “*please*?” Her faced was pained with need, prickles of sweat painting her forehead and chest.

You smiled wickedly at her. “Want me to fuck you harder, huh?” you asked breathlessly, “Make you come against my fingers?”

She nodded helplessly.

“Gotta say it, Abby,” you demanded with a haughty raise of your eyebrows.

Abby winced, and closed her eyes, taking an enormous gulp of air. “Please, baby,” she looked at you with pleading eyebrows, and she looked so damned cute and hot and complete mess all at once—and it made your own cunt throb deliciously. “Fuck me harder, wanna come—” more ragged breaths, and then ”—I wanna come around your fingers, want you to *feel* me.”

“*Fuck*, Abby—well, when you say it so nicely like that…” you huffed in reply, and pulled your lip between your teeth. You lined up another finger at her entrance, and she was absolutely dripping. “Being so good for me, aren’t you? Gonna make you come so hard, Abby,” you breathed out, as you plunged three fingers deep inside her.

The resistance of her pussy around your fingers made your cheeks flush hotly, and the way Abby’s eyes widened in bliss, neck arched backward, made you feel drunk with desire.

“Fffff—oh my—*hngggh*, yeah. *Fuck*!”

“You like that? Hmm?” you goaded, as you felt her walls clamp around your fingers again.

“Jesus, fuck—” she simply whined in reply.

The awkward angle of your hand was causing your fingers to ache as you manoeuvred it between her clothes and her body so as to fuck her relentlessly—but you didn’t care. Watching Abby come apart like this beneath you, *because* of you, was heady and intoxicating.

When the tips of all three of your fingers found the sensitive spot on her inner wall and curled towards it, she shuddered bodily and let out an groan so low it was as if you could feel it in your own chest. Your hand was completely soaked with her arousal, and you were desperate to bring her over the edge. Your own breaths were ragged, too, and your collective pants and moans mingled with the dirty sounds of your fingers pounding in and out of her; the air full of the heady scent of sweat and slick.

Finally, you allowed the pad of your thumb to drag over her sensitive, swollen clit, and she practically lost it. Her hips canted forward, bearing down harder against your hand.

“Ugggh—*so* good. *Fuck*! ‘M so fucking close,” her voice was strained and needy, the tension in her entire body threatening to spill over at any second.

You increased the pace of your thrusts, continuing to work your fingers unceasingly against her g-spot. Her arousal dripped into the palm of your hand as you fucked into her harder and harder. Her knuckles were white as her hands clenched tightly against the arm rests of the chair.

“Oh my fucking god, *fuck*!” she whined. “Ugh, ‘m so close, baby—*please,* don’t stop!” she begged, panting and moaning in your ear.

“Yeah, that’s it, come for me Abby, wanna watch you fall apart,” you breathed out against her ear, as her walls pulsed deliciously around your fingers. You worked deeper against her g-spot, and pressed your thumb more aggressively against her sensitive nub.

“Oh *fuck* yeah! Ohhh baby—I’m coming, I’m—!”

Abby let out an ungodly moan from deep in her throat as her pleasure overwhelmed her. A powerful shudder wracked her body, as the walls of her cunt clamped against you. She came hard, eyes pressed tightly closed and breaths coming fast as her hips jerked erratically towards your hand.

You fucked her through her orgasm, feeling her walls twitch and pulse intensely against your fingers, as her voice deteriorated into a series of satiated grunts and moans.

When her breathing subsided, you stilled your hand, and pressed your own sweaty forehead against hers and closed your eyes.

You let out a breathy sigh, head swimming pleasurably in the wake of how goddamned sexy she’d looked coming beneath your touch. You knew you’d remember how good she looked in that moment for a *very* long time.

You eased your fingers out of her, and pressed your hand, still wet with her arousal, to her chest, feeling it rise and fall as her breathing evened out.

“Fuckkk, Abby,” and you huffed out a very quiet chuckle, “how do you *possibly* manage to look so damned attractive, even when you’re *coming*?” A puff of hot air escaped your lips as you smirked at her.

She just looked up at you, eyes half-closed and hazy, a sweet, post-orgasmic look of contentment on her face. She looked so gorgeous in this moment: none of that imperceptible look in sight; no brows furrowed in serious contemplation; just Abby, dazed, blissed out, and happy.

You pressed a soft kiss to her forehead, and she tilted her head up towards yours in response, pressing a kiss of her own to your chin.

After another gentle sigh, she finally spoke.

“Am I… allowed to move my hands now?” she asked carefully, peering up at you, with a deferent-but-hopeful expression.

You smirked, and let out a small laugh.

“Yes, you can move your hands.”

One of Abby’s hand moved to the small of your back, and the other to where your hand rested against her chest, covering it with her own. She pulled your hand up to her mouth and kissed it tenderly.

“Hm, you smell like me,” she said, sounding pleased, and a smugly-satisfied smirk broke out across her face.

“Well, I mean—hardly surprising given your come is *all over* my fucking hand. Jesus christ, Abby—you were so wet, it was like—” you couldn’t find the words, and instead finished with a little huff that was also a small chuckle.

“Well, *you* have magic hands, so what do you *expect*? I mean, *fuck*—*how* do you… it’s like, no one has ever…” she bit her lip and rolled her eyes back briefly to illustrate her point, giving your ass cheek a hungry squeeze to communicate her gratitude. “You have no idea how hard it was to stop myself from putting my hands all over you, you know. *I* deserve a fucking *medal*,” she huffed self-righteously.

“Oh, poor *Abby*,” you looked at her with mock sympathy, “*so* hard done-by! How *ever* will I make it up to you?” you teased with a small laugh.

“Oh, you *still* wanna tease me, huh? After all that?” she smiled, but her eyes were dark with desire, her eyelids lowered. She reached a hand up behind your head, and slid her index and middle fingers into the hair at the base of your neck.

“Maybe it’s time for a little *payback* for all the teasing. What do *you* think?” she purred quietly, as she pulled your mouth down towards hers with exacting pressure against your neck.

You bit your lip again, and then her mouth found yours, and she kissed you deeply as she grasped your ass ravenously with her well-muscled hand.

<h3>Chapter End Notes</h3>
<p>There's a part 2 of sorts to this chapter, where Abby will definitely rail our dear reader in her office. But I really just wanted to get this epic bit of smut into your hands, my thirsty friends. Those tennis shorts are still coming (I literally cannot wait to write Abby in those shorts, y'all! 🥵) in the next chapter or two, and I'm thinking we may even get to meet Lev briefly? Or maybe a bit of a reappearance from everyone's fave co-pilot Dina? What do y'all reckon?
At this point, I've changed the number of chapters to a big old '?' because I'm having so much fun writing this, and I feel like I'm changing up the chapter total every time I write. I expect we'll eventually land somewhere between 16–20 chapters, but we'll see when we get there. Can't believe I've been writing this fic for 3+ months now! I'm really happy that I've been able to sustain my focus and I'm still so excited to write these characters after all this time. It's very satisfying and enjoyable!
I'll probs take a bit of a brain break for a week or so, just to let my tired mind recover from what's been a gauntlet of hectic work and life things, plus bringing this chapter to life—but please don't fret: I am very much dedicated to these babes and want to make sure I can keep writing at a sustainable pace so I can keep this story moving along. It's really awesome having an overarching story I'm so keen to see through, even though a lot of the plot and details are still evolving as these characters lead the way. It's a weird writing journey, but I'm learning so much from this approach.
As always, your comments feed my creative brain juices. I read every single one, and I do my best to reply when I have the headspace. All your lovely words really kept me going while things were tough in these last few weeks, and every single comment means so much! Honestly, I've not written a lot of big pieces of writing, and didn't expect there to be that many people that would engage in this story the way y'all have. I'm truly thankful there are so many dedicated (and thirstly, lol) Abby stans out there who love this character as much as I do!</p>

<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>What a time, my babes, what a time. Firstly, thanks for your patience whilst I got the rest I needed to get back in the right headspace for writing. Work really did a number on me at the end of the year.
Thankfully, my break over the holidays was thoroughly restorative, and in my final week of vacation, Abby all of a sudden just popped up her head again, dropping all sorts of wonderful suggestions into my brain, and ever since then, it's been on!
I've been writing in earnest on and off for the last 3 weeks or so, and I've edited and re-edited this chapter so many times in the last 6 days to get it juuuuust right. I think every night for the last week or so, I've been like, "yeah tonight it will finally be done!" but then something wouldn't be working quite right and I'd have to rearrange evvvvverything. It's been a challenging one!
So, with that in mind, I'm really glad to have this at the state it's at: around 12k words, most of which is Abby just tormenting the living hell out of our dear reader with a few little moments of blissful release scattered in between. This chapter is an absolute smut-fest, and I hope that all the build-up has made this chapter worth it for y'all!
One of the weird things about writing smut is that it can be hard to step back and appreciate it as you're writing it. One thing I can say about this chapter, though? It was a very satisfying journey, and I think y'all are in for an absolute treat.
I want to say a special thanks for all the love and support y'all have given me since I posted the last chapter. So many of you said such kind, wonderful things, and encouraged me to take my time, even though I know y'all are just as thirsty for Abby/Reader content as I am. My goal for this fic has always been to write from a place of joy and in a way that makes me proud; to make the story as good as I'm able and the smut as delightful as possible, whilst trying not to worry too much about it being perfect. Your patience and support has really made it so much easier to write from that space.
Every comment, every word of encouragement, every single kudos—and that one person who gave me my first KoFi, bless your cotton socks—is so appreciated. Hearing about how this story has landed with you in different ways, and the things you're enjoying, really helps to guide my writing. So: a massive thanks for taking the time to engage (and keep it coming!).
Okay. That's it! Buckle up, my fellow Abby-appreciators, and enjoy.
PS: If you want to support my writing (and *please* only do so if you're in a position to!) you can head on over to https://ko-fi.com/lestigres . It really is appreciated, but is in no way expected.</p>

When Abby’s lips met yours, there was a power behind them—a *want*—that you could *tell* she was hardly able to contain, as if willing herself with every fibre of her being to hold back the full force of her desire.

Her mouth traversed your lips, your jawline, your neck, and your cheeks—with a hunger you both knew could only be satiated through the exacting of pleasure upon your body by *more* than mere kisses. Her breaths fell heavy on your skin, and her teeth drew sharp against your flesh; every so often a tiny, rumble-of-a-groan would fall from her throat, immediately invoking a pang of lust to thrum low in your abdomen and arousal to pool between your thighs.

As her desperate kisses began to chart every inch of flesh from your collarbones up, you felt Abby rise from the chair that you had previously bound her within. She drew herself up to her full stature, cupping your jaw in one of her large hands while the other grasped at the crease where your ass met the back of your upper thigh, urging your hips firmly towards hers. Your hands moved along her collarbones, fingertips gliding beneath the soft, warm fabric of the business shirt that draped haphazardly from her shoulders. When you glanced down to take in the rippled lines of her abdomen in the dim light of the room, her mouth curved into a smug grin in response.

At her full height, Abby towered over you, and for the first time in weeks, you remembered just how imposing she could appear. Your mind flashed back to the first time you’d seen her in the clearing in front of her cabin, axe raised overhead before swinging it through the air with an almighty force that split wood in two with a deft efficiency.

Thinking back to that moment, it struck you how unexpected all the things that had transpired since that first day you met her had been. Even just the events had come to pass in the space of *today* had surprised you: her intervening with Isaac; the talk in the car where she’d seemed to forget her she was supposed to be upset; the apology; and the confession of her feelings for you.

And it was all culminating in this moment: Abby’s hulking form half-naked in front of you and a palpable heat between you both that made you know for certain you were about to get thoroughly *railed* by her.

*Fuck.*

Abby pulled her face back from yours, eyelids lowered and her breath landing in shallow puffs of hot air that danced against your face. You exhaled slowly, eagerly awaiting her next move. The air seemed to crackle around the both of you.

“You *know* you’ve been making it so hard for me, don’t you?” she huffed breathily, voice low and husky. Her words were laced with the *smallest* hint of frustration—but with *so* much *need*, too, that your cunt twitched violently in response and you let out another shuddered breath that made her lip curl. “Been giving me eyes across the office *constantly*. Think I didn’t see? You looking over at me from your desk?” Abby’s eyebrows raised as she said this, and she bit her lip hungrily. She eyed you up and down as the hand at your butt kneaded the flesh there firmly, and you moaned. “Of course I fucking saw you,” she continued, chiding softly, her voice now purring directly in your ear in between intermittent nips of her teeth and darts of her tongue against your neck and earlobe.

The fingers of her left hand dipped beneath then hem of your shirt to explore the expanse of you—your abdomen; your sternum; the length of your neck—leaving behind the occasional scrape of fingernails as it worked it’s way up your body. Her thumb and index finger hooked either side of your jaw to angle your neck so she could feast upon the flesh there. The grip of her fingers was powerful, almost rough.

You shuddered in reply to intensity of her touch, and you were panting shallow, ragged breaths directly into her ear. It was like she’d been holding back how much she’d wanted you—but now the cracks were well and truly showing, and you sensed that she was struggling to restrain herself.

She continued dripping her honeyed words into your ear in between the ministrations of her mouth and hands.

“You sitting at your desk looking cute as hell, blushing every time I caught you staring at me. But you still wouldn’t tell me what you wanted, would you? What you wanted me to do to you. You made me wait. So indecisive; made me *so* frustrated.” Her voice was dark, and her teeth pulled carelessly against your earlobe before following up the sharp sensation with a soothing drag of her lower lip.

Abby’s own breath was heavy and guttural, coming out in intense puffs. She was worked the fuck up, and it was hot as hell.

Her right hand, meanwhile, was all over you, grabbing your ass and then hitching one of your legs up around her waist as she ground her thigh into your apex, pushing your butt backwards onto the edge of her desk as she did so.

Her teeth were rough against your neck, lips curled into a snarl before soothing the skin with her tongue.

“Can’t make up your mind what you want, can you?” she said, voice rough. “I guess I’ll have to show you. Want me to show you? Want me to fuck you here bent over my desk?”

You whined a little louder than you would’ve liked.

“Baby, that’s not good enough,” she breathed wickedly, “You gotta say it,” and she paused, looking darkly into your eyes as if to remind you of the ways in which you’d made her suffer earlier that evening with a *‘see, I told you there’d be payback’* kind of look.

“Well?” she continued, as she drove her thigh against the crotch of your pants, “Do you want me to fuck you? Want me to make you come all over my hands?”

Her mouth was going wild against your neck and your jaw, the wetness of her saliva left as traces of her devotion on your flesh. One of her hands was still at your waist, thumb pressing firm circles into your hip, fingers grasped vice-like against your butt cheek as she held you against her; and all the while the hand up your shirt snaked lower as it explored your chest with her fingertips.

She pulled all the way back to regard your dishevelment as she awaited your answer, making sure to press her thigh against your heat with a with sufficient pressure to cause your stomach to flutter with desire. Your head was swimming, and you were so desperate for her to fuck you that it was all you could do to keep yourself standing upright, staring at her in a sex-drunk stupor as you tried your best to locate the suitable words in your brain with which to respond.

The best you could manage was to nod somewhat pitifully—and, *is that drool collected at the corner of my mouth?* you wondered; *quite likely*;—before responding pathetically with, “*Please,* Abby—I *need* you—”

But that was enough for her.

It happened so quickly: Abby’s hands wrested the remainder of your shirt free of the waist of your trousers and then slid beneath the fabric and up the length of your chest. You helped her to pull your clothing off over your head and she discarded it on the surface of her desk off to the side as both hands moved to the small of your back to pull you urgently against her. Her lips immediately returned to yours, as the two of you wholly devoured each other in your desire, tongues dancing wetly in one another’s mouths.

As if seeming to realise all of a sudden that she was still wearing her business shirt, Abby pulled back briefly to peel it off her body, making swift work her sports bra also, giving you a momentary glimpse of the taught muscles of her arms and shoulders as she lifted them above her head.

*Holy hell she is a sight to behold*, you thought, mouth lolling open as you glanced down at this adonis before you: naked from the waist up, trousers barely hanging on at her hips, and the waistband of her boxers in disarray from where your hand had disappeared beneath them not fifteen minutes prior.

Abby looked as though she could hardly wait to consume you: her cheeks were flushed and her mouth was slightly agape; her pink, pieced nipples, pebbled and pointed in your direction, looked so enticing you wanted immediately to pull them into your mouth. There seemed to be a sort of energy or electricity—*a raw power*—vibrating through her.

“Abby, *jesus*—” your eyes glanced up and down the perfectly-sculpted visage before you, “you are so fucking gorgeous it makes me want to fuck you all over again,” you whispered in a heady voice. You pulled your lower lip between your teeth.

She sneered at you, eyes narrowed, as she shook her head defiantly. “Nuh-uh, no way. It’s *my* turn,” she denied you.

But it was pretty hard to be upset as her enormous hands slid around your waist to pull you against the warmth of her now-naked torso, as her mouth found yours with renewed hunger.

It felt so good to have her body fully flush with yours for the first time in what felt like forever that you closed your eyes, and melted into the sensations of everything she was making you feel. A soft, satisfied hum escaped amongst your kisses.

Abby groaned softly in return.

“Been wanting to feel your skin against mine since…” she faltered briefly, “since that… first night.” The fullness of her lower lip graced your own with soft, delicate kisses, and you could feel her hot breaths coming slowly now. “Like, even when I was *annoyed* at you—” she let out a brief chuckle as she said it, “I kept trying to get you out of my mind, but—you were just… there. It’s been driving me fucking crazy, seeing you sitting over there,” and she gestured her head casually over your shoulder to the general direction of your desk, “wanting you, wanting to *feel* you again,” and her voice ground down to a low hum as her kisses drifted from your mouth, across your cheek, and to your earlobe, “wanting to fuck you til you came undone for me,” she finished quietly, now speaking directly into your ear.

You moaned again, and then she bit against the flesh of your lobe.

“Fuck. Can’t wait to feel how wet you are,” she continued, teeth finding your neck while her hands moved to your belt to swiftly unfasten it and work at your fly. When she was finished, she ground her thigh against your heat once more, and your cunt lurched as you let out a shaky breath. You were *so* desperate to feel her, too.

“Ugh, need to feel you *so* badly, Abby, *please*—” you begged, hips canting towards her.

Her mouth found yours as her fingers crept south of the waistband of your underwear, and then she cupped her hand against your mound through the fabric, teasing you.

You shuddered violently, *involuntarily*, in response, and she bit her lip, a wicked smile at the corner of her mouth.

“Aww, don’t worry, baby. Just a little bit longer, I promise,” she taunted, her tone insufferably patronising. Abby could be so arrogant it was infuriating, for sure—but she was so damned hot it was hard to care right now.

Your breathing was ragged as her hand cupped your heat. Your underwear was soaked, that much you knew, and it was only moments until she realised that for herself.

“Jesus fucking christ,” she whispered harshly as she felt the mess your arousal had left in its wake. Her jaw slackened further as she pressed a single finger into the soaked fabric along the length of your slit. “Fuck. You’re… fuck. So fucking wet.” Her mouth was agape, pupils blown wide as she touched you, and her need for you obvious.

“Well, *these* are coming off immediately,” she drawled, grasping at the waist of your trousers with her gaze fixed on you. You nodded eagerly, lip between your teeth as your hands pressed flat against the desk to lift your hips up for her. Abby made short work of your trousers and underwear, stopping briefly to unlace your shoes so that you could swiftly kick them off with your heels, before pulling the last of your clothing off over your feet.

Well—*almost* the last.

“Socks,” you insisted, waggling your feet at her expectantly, and she smirked at you as she peeled them off, and then she stood before you, quietly taking in the sight of you cutely perched on the edge of her expensive, oaken work desk.

You could have felt quite vulnerable sitting there, completely naked, ankles crossed, and hands pressed coyly atop the desk. But with Abby’s heated gaze devouring every inch of you, you felt more desirable than you think you’d ever felt til that moment.

Her attention finally settled upon your crotch, and she moved a hand to the back of her neck—bicep flexing *deliciously* for you a she did so—and pulled a perfectly-full lip between her teeth. A low, barely-audible growl reverberated from somewhere within her, and you could’ve sworn in that moment that all the moisture in your body went directly to the place between your thighs.

You let out a needy sound, eyebrows pleading as Abby’s body moved slowly—*too* slowly—towards you.

“Abby—” you whined, “I *need* you. Please. *Please?*” you begged, and you reached out to her, yanking her towards you with both hands wrapped around the back of her neck the moment she was within reach of your grasp.

You encircled her waist with your legs, and she took the opportunity to scoop you up in those enormous hands of hers and move your butt a little further back from the edge of the desk so she could tower over you imposingly.

The look of lust in her eyes as she descended towards you was everything. She used a single finger to tilt your chin up towards her face, and her mouth found yours with an intensity that was as-yet unmatched, tongue parting your lips to entwine voraciously with yours. Then, holding you steady with one hand on your waist, she gyrated her hips towards yours, grinding her thigh intensely against the wetness of your cunt as she did so.

The sound you made was so unexpectedly loud and needy that it made her smirk. You allowed your upper body fall backwards against the smooth wooden desktop. She curled a hand beneath each of your knees and hiked you back towards her so you were flush with her thigh. She continued grind against you, the flat of one palm coming to press firmly against your abdomen, fingertips grasping hungrily at your flesh.

Watching her work her thigh against your heat was so indescribably sexy, and you buried one hand in the back of your hair as you relaxed your body against the wooden desk in absolute ecstasy, head falling backwards briefly in a heady daze.

You lifted your gaze to stare directly into Abby’s eyes, and her pupils were dilated as she stared ravenously back at you, mouth hanging open with want.

“Fuck, you don’t happen to have a strap handy in one of those desk drawers, do you?” you asked hopefully, knowing the likely answer. “Because this angle would be… *completely* fucking perfect,” you sighed breathily, your clit pulsing noticeably at the thought.

“Uh-uh,” she said, as she shook her head slowly, letting one of her hands drift to your forehead to comb her fingers through your sweaty hair. One of your hands found hers and you pulled the tips of her index and middle fingers to your lips, relishing the feel of her as your eyes fell closed.

Abby leaned down to kiss you as she continued grinding against you. “But don’t worry, baby—” her lips moved to your jawline, then to your neck— “I don’t need a strap—” kisses dotted your collarbone, and now, your sternum, “to make you feel *really* fucking good,” she finished, and then she latched her mouth around one of your nipples and sucked so hard that you couldn’t help but buck your hips up against her roughly.

“Fuuuuuuck…” you sighed, contentment washing over you. “Ffffuuuuhhh… Abby, jesus, *yeahhh*,” and as her mouth worked your nipple with her teeth and tongue, she continued her steady grinding movements against your wet cunt.

The hand at your hip released its hold on you, and the pads of her fingers drifted slowly through the patch of hair atop your pubic bone and towards your centre. You bit your lip, silently pleading for her to hurry the fuck up and touch you the way she knew you wanted her to.

Your hips canted involuntarily up towards her in anticipation, and her eyes looked up at you from her position at your chest as you watched your other nipple disappear into the hot abyss of her mouth. She made a deliberate show of pulling painfully slowly against it with her teeth, then soothing it with the plump flesh of her lower lip.

Abby’s breathing was shallow and intense as her fingers drifted lower and lower. The movement of her hand halted, hovering just *barely* above your labia.

She was deliberately withholding her touch from you, that infuriating fucking eyebrow cocked as she blinked her eyes slowly, smoulderingly, in your direction.

Your mouth hung open, brows furrowed in concentration and your face *begging* her to relent.

Then, with her eyes trained on yours with a hot gaze, she allowed her middle finger to fall between the cleft of your pussy and drag *so fucking slowly* through your slippery folds that you thought you might combust. She finished it’s path with a light *flick* against your sensitive clitoris.

Your hips shuddered, your chest heaved, and your cunt clenched *fiercely* in response.

“Oh my… fucking… *GOD*,” you gasped, eyes drifting closed as you melted beneath her touch. You had to pull your feet up to the edge of the desk to steady yourself

Abby’s free hand reached forward to stroke along your jawline *so* softly, thumb landing upon your parted lips.

Your eyelids fluttered at the unexpected affection.

You looked at her lasciviously as you pulled the digit into the heat of your mouth, grazing it with your teeth and then slowly dragging your tongue against the pad of her thumb.

And of course—Abby took this *precise* moment to allow the finger of her other hand to dip between your labia for a second time, this time, moving further downwards to tease cruelly at your entrance.

A protracted, raspy groan left your lips, your teeth clamping down on her thumb momentarily before releasing it so that you could crane your neck back in satiety, dragging a wet stripe of your saliva over your chin and down the centreline of your neck.

When a gravelly moan escaped her mouth in response, the sound pulled threads inside of you that made your whole body writhe in satisfaction.

Abby was now sliding her finger lazily back and forth along the length of you, pausing to flick your sensitive nub every other stroke. Her other hand firmly grasped the soft flesh at the side of your waist, and all the while, she regarded you through eyes that were so narrow they were barely slits.

“Fuck, baby… your pussy is *soaked* for me,” she panted, her breaths coming thick and fast as she glanced down at the hand buried between your thighs, her pupils blown even wider now. “Should *probably* be illegal for you to feel this wet, y’know,” she finished in a drawl, her mouth hanging open.

Abby’s eyelids were heavy, and she looked absolutely intoxicated by the sight her fingers disappearing between your drenched folds over and over again. Every so often, she would tease the pad of her finger against your opening, causing your hips to lurch violently towards her—only for her to pull away and deprive you of the satiety she *definitely* knew you were seeking.

On each occasion Abby would graze against your entrance, she would linger just a *liiiiittle* longer. It was driving you fucking crazy, winding the tension below your belly tighter and tighter.

It was utter torment.

It felt *so* fucking good and *thoroughly* insufferable, all at the same time.

“Fuck, Abby!” you finally snapped, genuine frustration laced in your words. You were coming undone from the way she was teasing you. You looked at her pleadingly.

She responded like the devastating asshole you knew she could be.

“So *needy*, baby,” Abby drawled, voice soft, slow, deliberate—*dangerous*—using the same words you’d taunted *her* with earlier that evening back against you.

And of course, that fucking eyebrow of hers arched smugly at the same time her mouth pulled into a lopsided smirk.

Fuck.

You *loved* seeing her like this.

Like the arrogant, self-assured, dominant muscle jock she had been the first time she’d fucked you. It was the same way she’d been when she’d spread her legs wide for you, sitting casually on the edge of the bed in her cabin, waiting for you caress her sex with your tongue that first time you’d eaten her out.

To be fair, though—you also totally *hated* her being like this: denying your every want, making you wait so fucking long, drawing out the agony of your arousal that you’d already been suffering through for the last several *weeks*. It was fucking *torture*.

But \*goddammit—\*you loved it *more*.

Because *this* Abby made you so fucking turned on.

And so, you mustered the best scowl possible in an attempt to bite back at her domineering turn of phrase—but seconds later, her finger was against the wetness of your opening, and you suddenly forgot what you were meant to be annoyed about.

Abby’s expression, meanwhile, was lewd and indecent. She was well and truly relishing in how much of a frenzy she’d worked you into.

“D’you wanna feel me inside you, is that it? Huh?” Her eyebrows hitched expectantly at you, finger traversing the length of your slit once more, causing your eyes to roll back in your head momentarily before you could return your gaze to hers.

She merely continued her torrid rhetoric, the words dripping off her tongue.

“Want me to fuck you until you beg me to stop? Until your cum is dripping all over my hands?”

*Fuck.* Her words somehow made you even wetter, though you could hardly believe that was *possible* at this point. Your pulse was racing, and your breathing shallow. You couldn’t recall ever having been so desperately in need of another person before.

To be touched. To be fucked. To be filled by her until you saw stars, and ‘til your brain melted into mush and you could no longer walk.

You were so eager for her that you had unconsciously propped yourself up on your elbows, looking expectantly at her.

Because Abby had paused the tip of her finger *juuuust* against your opening, rubbing tiny circles in the ample quantity of your arousal that was pooled there.

She was deliberately keeping you *right* on the precipice of your pleasure.

Making you wait.

You head bobbed, breathing laboured, staring at her desperately with your lip pulled between your teeth.

“Abby—please. Fuck me. Or at least—*kiss* me? Just—*anything*,” you pleaded, reaching out for her. She moved a hand to support your lower back, while the other hovered tantalisingly at the threshold of your core.

“How about I do both,” she offered in a low growl as she lowered herself towards you.

And as her mouth found yours in a deep, heated kiss, she eased two thick fingers inside you, and you felt as though your whole body might explode with sensation.

“Ohhhh fuuuuuuckkk...” you exhaled heavily, intoxicated by the feeling of her.

“Fuck, baby,” Abby panted, her own voice straining, “How do you feel *this* good? My fucking *god.*” She exhaled hotly and pressed her forehead against yours, overwhelmed by the sensation of you.

Abby’s fingers moved slowly and deliberately, but her thrusts inside of you were immediately deep. She wasted no time in curling her long, broad fingers upwards into your spongy inner wall, and you could feel your cunt immediately twitch and flutter as her fingers stretched you out, and at the deliberate intensity with which she was fucking you.

She felt sublime inside of you.

Fuck, how you’d missed this.

It was as though she had already mapped out all the intricacies of you: knew the most sensitive parts of you, the most delicious angles to hit, and the exact amount of pressure required to tip you over into a state of euphoria.

You were trying desperately to hold yourself up, but your arms were quivering unsteadily.

“Fuck Abby, feels s-so good,” you stuttered, your head lolling back in satisfaction and giving her perfect opportunity to lave at the skin of your neck with her teeth and tongue.

“You take my fingers so fucking well, baby,” she crooned between hot kisses as she fucked you. “You’re so fuckin’ wet for me, feels so fucking perfect. I could fuck you all *day* with the way your pussy is devouring me,” and she curled her fingers more ardently against your inner wall.

A loud moan fell from your lips, .

“Harder?” she asked, voice rough, and you nodded immediately.

“Mmmhmmyeahhhhyes,” you managed, your words blurring into one another.

She nodded, smile stretching wide with satisfaction at your answer. “Hang on,” she said, and she lowered your back gently down with her hand, pulled one of your legs up and over her shoulder, then moved the hand to your hip so she could more precisely exact

“Mmm yeah, much better,” she nodded, eyes dripping with sex while she looked down at her fingers as they resumed their powerful, deep thrusts into the wet mess of your cunt.

Abby bit her lip as she appraised the view, chest rising and falling noticeably as she pounded her fingers harder and deeper into you. She leaned her body into you a little more, the leg over her shoulder burning just a little, but the angle was so good, you didn’t fucking care: that could be tomorrow’s problem.

Your moans were coming thick and fast now, and each one caused the hot expression behind her eyes to intensify. She was getting off on this as much as you.

“Fuck. You look so fucking good getting fucked by me, baby,” and she manage to wrest her eyes from where her hands worked you so as to take in the euphoric expression on your face as you came unraveled. In response, one side of her mouth hitched into an indecorous smile, teeth slightly bared.

The sensations Abby was inflicting upon you were so divine, so *exquisite*, that it was as though every part of you was vibrating.

And so, when Abby moved her thumb so that it dragged against your clit with every thrust in and out of you, you just about lost it.

Your eyes squeezed tightly shut as your pleasure threatened to spill over.

“Oh god, oh *fuck*!” The words were falling from your lips and you were hardly conscious of what you were saying or how loud you were saying it. All you were aware of was the many ways in which Abby’s masterful fingers were bringing you closer and closer to the edge.

The leg Abby had hitched over her shoulder earlier made everything feel even more indescribable, stretching your body tightly and making the sensations of her fingers fucking into you even more intense. You could feel your walls twitching and pulsing tightly around her, and all the while, the noises spilling from your mouth grew louder and more guttural. You were dripping with sweat, and your breathing was intense, every part of you trembling and shaking.

“M’ so fucking close, Abs, *fuck*,” you panted, breath so ragged that the words were barely coherent. You arched your neck back, and pressed a hand to your sweaty brow as your teeth pulled against your lower lip.

“Yeah, *fuck*,” she said hotly, urging your climax onward, “You look so good right now, all messy for me. Look at me, baby—” and she dug her fingers into the flesh of your abdomen, “Wanna watch you fall apart,” and the look of lust on Abby’s face when you met her eyes was unmistakeable.

Strands of her blonde hair hung unkempt around her face and neck, a few strands plastered against her sweat-soaked forehead. Her pupils were blown *so* wide, and a single bead of moisture trickled from her brow down one of her pink-flushed cheeks.

She *needed* to see you fall apart, such was her dedication to your bliss.

And just the sight of Abby, so *consumed* by you, made the knot of sensation inside deep within you wind tighter and tighter.

You folded an arm beneath your head as a way of bracing yourself for all that was about to course through you, because you could feel the delicious pressure in your abdomen rising, threatening to burst forth. Your hips pushed upwards into Abby’s hand as her fingers pounded harder and deeper inside you, fingertips nudging unceasingly against your g-spot, each stroke further coaxing forth your release.

And then—

“Oh *fffuck*! Abby, I—” your eyes went wide as your ecstasy reached its peak.

“Mmm yeah,” she hummed, “Let go, baby,” and her voice was somehow silky and gravelly all at once.

Your orgasm washed over you, cunt clenching like a vice around Abby’s fingers as she fucked you through it all, body arched against the surface of the desk.

She curled her fingertips against your inner wall every so often as the tremors coursed through you, causing your cunt to thrum all over again, and further dragging out the sensations as they wracked your body. Your head fell backward, eyes closed as you breathed through it all. Abby’s eyes remained focused on you the whole time, brows tensed and narrowed, attuned to every move, every twitch, every haggard breath.

In time, your breathing began to steady and while Abby slowed her movements inside of you, she didn’t withdraw her hand. As you floated down from your elysium, every so often, Abby would curl her fingertips just slightly into you, causing wonderful ripples of pleasure to pulse through your abdomen. She seemed to like dopey look that washed over your face each time she did it, too, and the sensation of fullness her fingers created inside of you made you feel *so good* in this moment.

Your leg, still draped over Abby’s shoulder, started to ache a little now your muscles were cooling down, and you wiggled your foot to get her attention. She grinned, realising the position you were still in, and pulled away from you just a little to wrap a careful hand around your ankle and help lift it down from her shoulder, dotting a few small kisses along your thigh and calf as she went, fingers pressing into you as you repositioned your leg and causing your stomach to swoop luxuriously. You smirked hotly at her and she made a gesture as if to say, *‘Can’t help it that I make you feel so good’* and you chuckled at her.

Your thigh was feeling particularly tight by this point, having spent the last *however long* stretched over Abby’s shoulder while she railed you. You winced, wriggling it and stretching it out and twisting it to either side.

Abby caught your pained expression, and moved her large hand to massage your thigh gently with those powerful fingers of hers.

“That okay, baby?” she asked soothingly, a look of concern across her face.

Your mouth stretched into a blissed-out smile, and you nodded, as Abby’s strong hand dutifully worked away the tension in your leg. The gentle pressure felt heavenly in the wake of your post-orgasmic bliss.

After a few moments, she smoothed the skin of your thigh with her palm, and then leaned towards you to press light kisses against your abdomen, then your stomach, then against the hollow blow your sternum, and up to your collar bone. Her eyes caught yours and you smiled at her sweetly through heavy-lidded eyes. The gentle affection felt utterly dreamy, and alongside the occasional flutter of her fingertips inside of you, elicited small aftershocks of sensation in the space between your thighs.

She continued like this for a few moments, just barely fucking you while she explored your body with her mouth. Her other hand traced delicate patterns on your skin, moving between the side of your ribcage and the soft, squishy bit of flesh at your waist. Her movements felt otherworldly in the wake of your climax.

After some time, her kisses began to drift languidly down your torso, from your chest, past your belly, and over your abdomen, until her mouth was feathering light kisses through the curls of hair that adorned your pelvis.

“Mmmm, Abby…” you hummed agreeably, and Abby’s eyes met yours and held your gaze.

Holding your gaze intently, her mouth ventured lower still, and there was something suddenly electric in the air between you both, and Abby’s eyes grew darker and sexier, and your breathing became heavier in reply. Her lips meandered downwards, kissing slowly, slowly, *slowly* over your labia, until—you felt her soft mouth brush feather-light against your clitoris.

Though she barely made contact, the heat that flooded your abdomen was immediate.

You gasped hotly, looking at her, mouth hanging open, your desire rising all over again. Abby met your eyes with hers, her free hand stroking soothingly against your abdomen, and continued the decadent work of her tongue against your flesh.

And as you watched her—Abby now pulled the sensitive nub of your clitoris into her mouth, sucking and caressing it against her tongue. She punctuated all of this with the slightest curl of her fingers towards your inner wall.

The combined sensation was so unexpected—so sublimely *erotic*—that your cunt squeezed tightly around her fingers, hips lurching involuntarily upwards as a shaky, needy whimper fell past your lips.

“Is this ok? Want me to stop?” she asked earnestly, releasing the bundle of nerves for just a moment while she spoke before suckling against it once more. Abby’s voice was barely audible, but you could tell by the sincerity in her eyes that she would have stopped had you asked her to.

She was *so* fucking sweet.

But there was *no way in hell* you wanted her to stop.

And so, you shook your head, eyes fixed on hers, your heated expression willing her onward.

Eyes still on you, Abby alternated the devouring of your clitoris by pressing tiny kisses to your labia, the tip of her tongue trailing gentle licks here and there as she went. The feeling of her mouth was so perfect that your insides flooded anew with the warmth of your arousal.

Your cunt lurched fiercely again, and you groaned loudly and bit your lip into your mouth, eyes still trained on Abby’s.

And from somewhere in the back of her throat, Abby groaned too, and it was so low, so urgent, so hungry—that you could feel the sound vibrate through you.

Her mouth stilled briefly. “I wanna watch you come again,” she said, her voice dark and soft.

She dragged her lower lip carefully across your oversensitive nub, sucking it into her mouth again, and your breath hitched sharply.

Abby’s eyes were transfixed on yours, awaiting your response.

*Were you exhausted?*

Absolutely.

*Was that going to stop you from giving yourself over to her again so she could completely destroy you for a second time tonight?*

Absolutely fucking not.

You needed to feel her again *so badly*. Your body was on fire for her. You didn’t care *how* exhausted you were.

And so, you nodded. “Fuckkkk… yes, Abby. Please—I *want* you… *need* you to make me come,” you pleaded, your voice barely above a whisper.

And with that, her blue eyes narrowed, and her mouth curled into a satisfied smirk before it dropped between your thighs again.

You blinked stupidly as you took in the intoxicating sight of Abby as her tongue and hands navigated your body. She started slowly, administering light flicks and sloppy kisses over your thighs and abdomen, before returning to your clitoris with her achingly-soft lips. Her long fingers crooked inside of you, but her movements were barely perceptible. She was taking her time, drawing out your pleasure.

With her head bent low over your body, you were provided a new angle from which to appreciate the well-defined musculature of Abby’s arms and shoulders. The bicep corresponding with the fingers that softly teased inside of you was curled tightly, and you could see the thick vein at the front of the bulging muscle twitch each time she subtly flexed her digits against the sensitive spot inside of you.

Her other hand, meanwhile, meandered slowly up your torso, delivering small rakes from her fingernails and then smoothing the flesh with her palm before continuing its agonising journey.

Eventually, the hand arrived at one of your nipples and Abby stroked the already-hardened peak with a lone fingertip. Your chest arched up into her touch, and you let out a small hiss of satisfaction. She worked the nub back and forth, teasing you, but not quite giving you the pressure you wanted no matter how obviously strained up into her touch.

Her mouth and hands worked you so expertly into a frenzy that your body was writhing under her touch. You buried your hand into the back of her hair, fingernails scraping at her scalp, as desperate moans trickled from your lips between heavy breaths.

And then, with deliberate timing—Abby’s thumb and finger closed sharply around your nipple while her lips simultaneously sucked the bead of your clit into her mouth.

Your vision went white.

The contrast of the simultaneous pain and pleasure shook you, and your hips involuntarily bore down, crashing the fingers inside of you against your already-sensitive g-spot.

Your audible groan—and the tight clench of your cunt around Abby’s fingers—made her lip curl, and caused a low, filthy grunt to escape her throat.

But then, quite unexpectedly—Abby carefully withdrew her hand from inside of you.

*What the actual fuck?!*

You whimpered momentarily, confused by her transgression, until you felt the tip of her tongue nudge against your tight entrance. Abby greedily lapped at the slickness pooled there with the flat of her tongue, then pulled back just enough so you could watch her lick her lips. The look on her face was obscene, and her chest rose and fell with laboured breaths.

“You taste so fucking good, baby,” she gasped, pressing her lips together in satisfaction. “And you’re still so goddammed wet. Next time we’re in a bedroom, remind me to make sure that you sit on my face, yeah? I wanna drink up every drop of you.”

Your mouth gaped hungrily at the filthy words dripping from her mouth.

Abby looked nonplussed by your reaction. Instead, she took the opportunity to nudge your clitoris with her nose while she teased at your wet opening again with her tongue, and your hips jerked in reply.

“Wha…?” you mouthed wordlessly at her.

*Why was she tormenting you this way?*

But just as you opened your mouth again to protest, Abby plunged her tongue inside of you, and you could’ve *sworn* you went slightly cross-eyed.

*Jesus fucking christ.*

She moved her thumb to rub tiny circles to your clit, increasing the pressure gradually while she fucked your dripping hole with her tongue.

“Ohhhhh, fuuuuck, Abby—” you keened, as powerful bolts of pleasure reverberated through you.

Abby ate you out with such greedy enthusiasm, and you did your best to keep your eyes open so as to *fully appreciate* the sight of her muscled frame as she did so—because honestly: it was hot as hell to watch.

You’d had plenty of *‘good-enough’* sex in your time, but the way Abby ate you out was different: she was all in, her attention honed acutely on only your pleasure, relishing in every twitch, every ragged breath, and every groan of satisfaction that reverberated through your body.

And you clearly weren’t the *only* one getting off right now, because Abby groaned noisily into your cunt every time your hips jerked uncontrollably up towards her face, and savouring every drop of your arousal she was rewarded with.

“Baby, you’re so needy again *already*,” she remarked coolly the fourth or fifth time your cunt hitched towards her in as many minutes. She pulled back from your cunt, lapping the flat of her tongue against your clit on the way.

Moving her hands to the edge of the desk, she pushed herself upright, shoulders tensing and flexing as she did so. She was still positioned between your knees,

Her face was smeared with your release, and she wiped some of it away with her fingers and then brought them up to her mouth, watching your eyes salaciously as she dragged her come-soaked fingers sexily across her lower lip.

“Fuck, *Abby*…” You were practically drooling.

*How* was she this *hot*?

You waited patiently for her mouth to return to the space between your thighs, but she merely flashed you a smouldering look, and placed her hand atop your pelvis

“What are you…? You’re… stopping?” You were floundering.

Abby didn’t say a word; she merely smirked as she rolled a pebbled nipple between her thumb and forefinger for the umpteenth time that evening, pulling sharply and causing your eyelids to flutter.

You gaped at her, a complete wreck, and the look in your eyes was one of wanton desire, mingled with utter disbelief.

You were *so* turned on by her, but *so frustrated* by her teasing, too. You looked into Abby’s eyes searching for *something*—compassion?; *mercy*, maybe?—but finding no sympathy whatsoever.

“What’s *wrong*, baby?” The look on her face was somehow simultaneously patronising *and* smouldering. “D’you need me to fuck you again with my fingers? Is that it?” she asked, as her thumb swiped casually, carelessly, across your clitoris, causing your hips to jerk uncontrollably again.

She looked slowly down at your cunt spread open before her, licked her lips at the disheveled sight of you, and then just as slowly returned her eyes back to yours.

“Fuck, baby. Look at you. You’re a complete mess for me. So desperate and needy. What should I do with you, hmm?” Another lazy swipe of her thumb across your clitoris caused another almighty throb inside of you. “Maybe I should turn you over and fuck you against my desk. Would you like that? Want me to fuck you from behind until you come with my hand inside of you?” As she said the words, voice low and husky, the look in her eyes was one of complete devastation.

*This* was a *different* Abby; a *darker* Abby.

“Well?” she asked, looking at you expectantly.

You were so desperate for her to touch you, you couldn’t find the words—so instead, you nodded pathetically at her, the desire painted on your face telling her everything she needed to know.

“Mmm yeah, thought you’d like the sound of that. C’mere,” she said, and her hand snaked behind your back to pull you up from the desk and into her arms so she could kiss the breath out of you.

Her lips—like yours—were swollen, and felt plump and hot against your own. She nipped and licked at you, her tongue seeking yours to deliver yet another searing kiss, and you happily complied.

Abby’s beefy arms enveloped you, holding you close as her mouth wreaked havoc upon you. You relished in the sensation of it, shrouded comfortingly in the white-hot heat of her naked torso. You could feel the hard metal of her nipple piercings against your chest as she pulled you even closer, and as she kissed you, you could hear low, soft, needy grunts escaping the back of her throat, and it made you want her even more.

*How does she feel so good? How is any of this real? How is she so damned handsome and sweet and dirty and gentle all at once?*

The thoughts swam through your mind, as Abby’s searing kisses moved to your neck, and then before you were even aware of what was happening, her hands flipped you around 180 degrees so that you were facing the window that looked out over the dim office beyond.

She slid a firm hand from your lower back up to your shoulders to push—assertively, but not roughly—between your shoulder blades, so you toppled forward slightly and had to brace yourself with your hands against the surface of her desk.

*Oh shit*, you thought.

She smoothed a broad palm down the length of your back, and you shivered. With both hands, Abby pulled your hips back so your ass was flush against her crotch. You craned your neck over your shoulder as best you could to peer back at her hulking frame, the sight of her imposing in the darkness.

She met your eyes with a smouldering look, and then redirected her attention down towards your ass before flicking her sultry eyes back to yours. “Mmm, you look so fucking good like this, baby,” she sighed, her voice finishing in a low rumble. The fingers at your right hip drifting silkily down the crease of flesh between your thigh and abdomen.

Abby braced herself with a forearm against the desk, and she lowered her body down towards your own. You felt her hard nipples brush against your back, and let out an eager sigh.

Her mouth painted along your spine with wet kisses. Beside you, you could see the muscles of her hand tensed, veins popping as it bore the heft of her substantial frame. The feeling of her warm, soft skin pressed against you was *everything*.

As she brushed her lips carefully against the shell of your ear, her fingertips traced lower and lower until they disappeared between your thighs.

Noticing the slick coating the skin either side of your cunt, Abby growled. “Fuck. Still so wet for me, aren’t you?” she murmured, her low voice speaking directly into your ear as she nipped at the lobe.

The muscles of your abdomen tensed in anticipation of her touch, and in response, she snarled in your ear and her fingers sunk into the flesh of your thigh with her strong hand, thumb nudging dangerously close the centre of you.

“You are so fucking sexy. I’m gonna *completely* destroy you,” she assured you—and when you panted audibly in response, she added, “Mmm, yeah, you’d like me to do that, wouldn’t you?” and then gyrated her hips against your own.

Abby’s hand moved lower to cup your cunt, squeezing your labia softly between her thick fingers, doing her best to catch the hardness of your clit between them in the process.

You moaned, louder this time. You were desperate to feel her inside you.

“Abby, I swear to god—if you don’t fuck me with your fingers soon, I’ll…” you pleaded, voice trailing off.

“You’ll what, baby? *Hmm*?” she quizzed, an air of superiority and power about her now. She squeezed the flesh of your labia between her fingers again, this time pressing her fingers more intently against you to grind at your swollen clit hidden underneath. She pulled your earlobe a little rougher between her teeth before following up with soft licks and kisses.

“Abby, *please*—” you crooned, voice breaking desperately.

Abby kissed your neck with those pillowy-soft lips of hers, and finally, allowed one thick finger to dip between your drenched folds. You shuddered violently beneath her touch, and she let out a low rumble.

“Oh, fuck, *Abby*…” Your voice came out in a strained and breathy whine, as her fingertip fell lower to tease at your entrance before pulling up to rub at your clit with two fingers.

“Jesus, *fuck*, you’re soaked, baby. Feels so fuckin’ good,” she grunted hotly in your ear.

She dragged her fingers up and down the length of your slit, from your clit to your wet opening and back again several times, fingers grinding against the hardened nub of your clit each time. The pace of your breathing escalated with the pace of her fingers, and all of a sudden you were struggling to hold yourself up off the desk.

All of a sudden, she pulled back from you for what felt like the millionth time tonight, pushing herself upright and smearing your release across your abdomen as she did so.

“Wha—?” you turned back to face her, puzzled.

Abby said nothing in response; just glowered at you with heavy-lidded eyes full of lust and nudged one of your feet a little to the side with her own, to spread your legs wider for her. You complied, and then she pressed the flat of her left palm against your lower back to push you bodily downwards towards the desk again.

Her other hand grasped the globe of your right ass cheek, kneading it firmly as you pushed your butt back against her, now *desperate* to feel her inside you. Her hand drifted down towards your burning core, two fingers coming to tease at at the wetness of your opening.

“Fuck, Abby—*please*—” you begged, voice breaking and breath heaving. Your head fell forward, and your legs shook.

She smoothed the skin of your lower back with one hand. “Don’t worry, baby, I’ll take care of you,” she whispered, and she finally eased two thick fingers fully inside of you, curling them just so when she was all the way in.

And when Abby’s fingers entered you, you swore to god you saw stars.

You braced your head against one of your arms and closed your eyes as a long, dragged-out groan escaped your lips.

“Oh, fuuuuuck, *Abs—*”

Abby withdrew her fingers almost all the way, and then thrust them back into you, a little rougher this time, emitting a low grunt as she did so.

“Mmm, yeah,” she said, looking down at her fingers disappearing into you again, and then back at the blissed-out expression on your face—eyes closed, mouth wide, hair all mussed up—that was silhouetted by the glow of the desk lamp.

She increased her pace, but made sure each thrust was deep enough that she could curl against the sensitive place on your inner wall that would make your cunt lurch in ecstasy each time she dragged against it. You could hear the dirty sounds of her fingers fucking into you peppered by the grunts she made each time her fingers were fully sheathed by you.

“Fuck, baby, you take me *so* well. Can feel your greedy pussy so tight around my hands,” she drawled between her own raspy breaths, and when you managed to open your eyes briefly, you could see Abby’s own arousal writ large across her face as she fucked you: eyes narrowed so they were barely slits, and a sex-drunk pout upon her face. “Want me to fuck you harder?” she asked.

“Yessss, yeah, uh-huh,” you managed, your words slurring. Your cunt clenched around her fingers with each thrust, your entire body trembling. You felt completely wrecked by her and she’d barely been inside you for more than a few minutes.

Her fingers thrust harder, the sensation against your g-spot more intense and overwhelming. You had to brace yourself against the desk more deliberately to stop yourself sliding forward on the smooth wooden surface.

“Yeah? That good?” she asked, her own breathing obviously laboured now. She repositioned her hand slightly so her thumb could rub the bead of your clit while she fucked into you with her fingers, and the tension within you soared to a whole new level.

“Mmmm, oh *fuckkkk*…” The words dripped from your lips between ragged breaths, but you were barely conscious of saying them. The tension below your belly tightened and your needy pussy clamped around her fingers. “Fuck, Abbyyyyyy… oh my *god*,” you purred, feeling a molten heat flood every part of you.

“You look so damned hot getting fucked by me, baby—could do this all night,” she said breathily, and she looked so turned on.

You were already on the brink of falling apart—and then, after one particular stroke, Abby paused abruptly her fingers fully inside of you, crooked them towards your abdomen, and fluttered them intensely back and forth against your g-spot.

“Oh my *fucking*—what the *FUCK!*” you yelped, your head swimming.

Abby stopped and looked at you, brows furrowed with sudden concern. “Are you ok? I can stop if—”

“*Don’t* fucking *stop*, *jesus*, Abby—*so fucking good*—” you blurted, one hand flailing helplessly back in her general direction and gesturing for her to continue. So, she withdrew her fingers again, and thrust hard into you, crooking her fingers against the oh-so-sensitive area after every few strokes.

“Oh my… *fuck*!” You felt like your whole being was about combust, sweat beading against your brow, your stomach, and the hollow of your back.

The heavenly combination of her thick fingers pounding into you, followed by the flutter of her fingertips against your inner wall, was tipping you over the edge.

“Feels so *good*, Abby,” you said between gulps of air, “god, m’ *so* close—” your body was trembling beneath you, arms weak and legs barely holding you up.

Abby could see you were barely holding it together. “Doing *so* fuckin’ good, baby, you can do it. Show me how good it feels when I fuck you like this,” she cooed softly.

Though you could barely keep your eyes open, you looked back at her to see her brows knitted together in intense concentration. Abby looked so fucking sexy as she railed you like this, the carved lines of her shoulders and arms visibly tensed as she urged you past your tipping point.

“Fuck,” you panted, “you feel *so* fucking good, Abby—*hngh*!”

Increasing the pressure of her thumb against your aching clit, Abby pushed herself harder and deeper into you, devastating your g-spot with her fingertips over and over as she coaxed forth your orgasm.

And *then*—

“Ohhhhhhh fffffffuuu—” Your eyes clenched shut and the noises that fell from your lips cracked and strained uncontrollably as your whole body shook violently. Tremors wracked through every inch of you, cunt clenching tightly around Abby’s fingers like a vice.

But Abby didn’t relent: she persisted to rub against that sensitive place on your inner wall as you convulsed around her, as cum coated her fingers and spilled onto her hand.

“Yeah, that’s it, baby, keep going. I got you,” she said in a hot whisper, fucking you through it all, drawing out the pleasure in a way that made your head spin.

The moans continued to pour from your mouth as wave after wave of pure sensation echoed through your body. Abby’s fingers continued their fluttering motion, until you had to reach out to her with one hand to still her, lest your body melt into a puddle of pleasure before her very eyes.

“Ohhhh…” you whimpered, noticing how pathetic you sounded. You collapsed on the desk, face smooshed against the back of your forearm, and your legs shook. Abby withdrew her fingers from you, which somehow made *yet another* shuddering wave vibrate through you.

You could hear your jagged breaths, and *was that…?* Yep, there was a small puddle of drool where your cheek had collapsed against the desk.

“Come here, baby. We made a bit of a mess of you,” Abby said with a gentle smirk, sliding a strong arm beneath your abdomen to pull you up on shaky legs.

“No! ‘M too *weak*—” you protested in a whine. You felt like a baby giraffe right now, liable to collapse at any moment. But Abby somehow spun you around, draped your arms over the steadiness of her broad shoulders, and lifted you onto the edge of her desk with her enormous hands so your body faced hers. You clasped your hands behind her neck for stability, and she reached down and pulled your legs around her waist.

“S’ok baby, I got you,” Abby reassured you soothingly, and so—you collapsed against her chest.

You felt the warmth of her arms envelop you, a hand moving to the back of your head to tangle her fingers into the sweaty mess of your hair. A small hum escaped your lips, and you turned your head to rest your cheek against her chest. It felt hot and a little sticky from the layer of sweat she’d worked up.

Little aftershocks of your orgasm reverberated through you, but Abby just smoothed your hair comfortingly with one hand, tucking errant strands back into place here and there, and pulled you tight against her chest with the other.

And so, you let yourself melt into the warmth of her.

“Abby…?” you murmured against her skin, voice barely above a whisper. Now that your senses were returning, you had the wherewithal to notice how dazed and sloppy your voice sounded.

“Yeah, sweet thing?” Her hand moved from your hair to rub your back. You pulled your arms down from around her neck and curled them up in front of you, and she used this as an opportunity to pull you closer still. You felt so safe and sure inside her unshakeable embrace.

“That was… so good,” you continued. “How did you…? No one has ever…?” The words tumbled out of your mouth in an incoherent mess.

Abby—in a very *Abby* sort of way—said nothing, but huffed quietly at you, and you felt her chest shake as she chuckled. You tilted your head just slightly towards her, and could see that her eyes were closed, blonde lashes catching in the dim light—but there was a triumphant sort of smirk spread wide across her cheeks.

“Pfft,” you huffed, “don’t look so damned *pleased* with yourself,” you chided, rolling your eyes, and she looked down at you, the blue pools of her eyes meeting your gaze.

“Whatever. I *am* pleased with myself. That was… I mean, *fuck*. You looked so fucking hot. Don’t know how I’m gonna get *any* work done tomorrow sitting at this desk,” and she exhaled a puff of hot air from her mouth that caused a few of the blonde hairs that had fallen around her face to flutter about.

“All I’ll be able to see is your face looking back at me while you came,” she continued, “And you were *so* loud and you looked *so* hot and… *fuuuuckkk*…” Abby rolled *her* eyes, now, and shook her head as she let out hot, breathy sigh.

You felt your cheeks grow warm, and you covered your face with your hands, a little embarrassed.

“Was I that *loud*? I’m not *normally* that loud, I swear, I—” and you winced again, burying your head in her chest to avoid her gaze.

Holding you securely with one beefy arm, Abby brought her hand to your chin and tilted it up to face her. “*Don’t* be embarrassed,” she insisted in a stern voice. “It was one of the sexiest fucking things I’ve ever heard,” she finished, biting her lip as her cheeks flushed crimson.

Her lips were parted slightly, and she looked at you hotly, like she could consume you *all over again* in a heartbeat.

“Anyway,” Abby continued, “Now I’m allowed to be even *more* pleased with myself,” and she smirked that arrogant smirk, her voice so cocky that you looked up at her and rolled your eyes.

“Oh *really*? Why’s that, huh?” you scoffed.

Abby’s hands gripped either side of your hips, and one dipped lower to squeeze your butt cheek.

“Because, now I know you’re *normally* not that loud,” she said in a smugly satisfied tone, tilting her head to one side and looking pleased with herself.

“Ugh… you’re *incorrigible*,” you sighed at her, but she merely shrugged in reply before threading her fingers into your hair again so she could tilt your head back and lean down to press a soft kiss to your lips.

You let out a contented sigh. “Mmm, Abby,” you croaked, “Kissing you is…” and you stopped short, closing your eyes in satisfaction and pulling your lip between your teeth.

“Mmm? Is *what*, baby?” she pressed in a sexy voice.

“Pfft, shut up. You don’t need any more help inflating your ego right now,” you playfully chastised.

“Hey, my ego is \*well-\*deserved in this moment,” she smirked.

You just rolled your eyes at her again.

“*Incorrigible*,” you huffed under your breath, chuckling before letting out a huge yawn.

About ten minutes later, despite your mutual exhaustion, you’d somehow managed to compose yourselves.

Abby had pulled two small, clean gym towels from a stash in one of her drawers—*of* course *she had a personal stash of gym towels*—and you’d gotten dressed and cleaned yourselves up sufficiently that when you walked past building security in the foyer, you’d *probably* just look as if you’d both worked an all-nighter.

Abby had needed to help you with your button-down, as you’d done it up all the way before realising you’d missed a button in the middle somewhere, and so the whole shirt was askew. She’d teased you insufferably, and then made a show of kissing you while undoing it all over again, until you had to push her away, threatening her by saying that if she kept kissing you, it’d be sunrise before she knew it, and you’d likely run into Doug on his way to yoga. That seemed sufficient motivation for her to pack up her belongings and get going.

You were just about to leave the office when you noticed something you’d both missed.

“Uhhhh Abby,” you said, smirking broadly, “you might wanna… do something about all of—*that*,” and you giggled, gesturing dramatically at her desk.

Abby followed your eyes to her desk inquisitively, and then blushed, a goofy smile spreading across her face.

It was covered with very obvious smears of sweat and arousal that were visible even in the low light from her desk lamp.

“Uhhhh, yeah. Heh,” she looked pleased with herself. “Good catch.”

She set down her laptop and suit jacket on the couch, and pulled a container of disinfectant wipes from one of her desk drawers to go over the whole surface.

“Did I get it all?” she asked, looking at you hopefully as a sleepy yawn escaped her.

“Looks good to me.” You yawned back, and then laughed.

“Awww, baby, let’s get you to bed ASAP,” she commented, pressing a kiss to your lips as she playfully slapped your butt.

She switched off the desk lamp and followed you to the lifts, closing her office door behind her.

Thirty minutes later, Abby’s Jeep pulled into the driveway at the Williams’s house. Her dogsitter had offered to stay over and take care of Bear hours ago, so you both figured it made sense to crash at your place, and then drive to hers in the morning to grab clothes and feed Bear before you went back to the office.

You figured that was *certainly* a better option than waking both of them up, *and* having a bunch of awkward explaining to do while you and Abby were both half asleep, and still both a bit stupid from having fucked each other into oblivion.

“You don’t have to stay over, though,” you said, as you were about to get out of the car, “it’s totally okay if you want to go home to Bear, and your poor dogsitter—”

“Don’t worry about it. It’s not an uncommon occurrence. God, it sounds kinda depressing when I say it like that, doesn’t it?” Abby resigned, screwing up her face.

You looked at her sympathetically. “You work too hard, you know,” you grimaced, and she nodded.

“So,” you started, voice suddenly salacious, “Your dogsitter… sleeps over a lot, huh? Anything I need to know?” you quizzed. You raised your eyebrow suspiciously at Abby. “Is this… someone I should know about…?”

“No—*no*! Oh, *god* no,” Abby looking panicked, and then laughed, as she realised what you meant. “Hah, noooo, it’s *nothing* like that. I’ll—explain tomorrow when you meet them.”

“Okay, sounds… intriguing?”

She shrugged. “Let’s just go up to bed,” she said, and then, “wait—unless you don’t *want* me to stay? I mean, I… I don’t want you to feel any pressure for me to, like, stay the night or whatever. Like, I’d really *like* to, but, like, I don’t want to… *impose*…” her voice trailed off, and the flush that rose in her cheeks was completely adorable.

You cocked your head to one side and raised your eyebrows, smirking at her.

*Was Abby fucking Anderson was being shy?*

Your heart thrummed in your chest and your stomach swooped. How could she be a total, arrogant piece of shit half the time, and then like… whatever *this* was?

“Don’t be dumb. Come snuggle me. Anyway, it’s cold tonight, and you seem to perpetually run, like, a *million* degrees hotter than me, so you’d be doing me a favour,” you finished, and Abby looked pleased with that.

“Well, as long as it’d be doing you a *favour…*” she teased. She leaned in to give you a soft, sweet kiss, and then you both exited the warmth of her Jeep.

And boy *was* it cold. Winter was well and truly setting in, and a sharp, icy-cold wind blasted you both as you hurried towards the house.

Your teeth were chattering by the time you reached the front door, and you turned on the heating immediately once inside. You led Abby up the wooden staircase, and down the hall to the guest bedroom you slept in.

She looked a little awkward, being in Anna and Joel Williams’s home without them actually *being* there—but you assured her that Anna had said guests were fine, just no parties.

As *if* you had the time or energy for parties these days.

Abby asked for a towel and face washer, and then disappeared into the bathroom for a while to clean up before bed.

You changed out of your work clothes, pulling on an oversized black sweater and a pair of stretchy cotton shorts, climbing into bed as quickly as possible and pulling the duvet up around your body.

You checked your phone while you waited for Abby to return, scrolling through the unread text messages from this evening.

One of the gallery owners you’d emailed about your exhibition had finally gotten back to you, saying they needed to chat with you about the scheduling and logistics of everything, which sounded promising.

You hadn’t heard back from any of the people you’d contacted about a week ago, and you’d been starting to get anxious about it all. You sent a quick reply, and then set yourself a reminder for Saturday to call them, and opened your conversation with Dina.

You were meant to have caught up with her this evening—well, last *night*, more accurately—but you’d texted her at 7pm while you were eating dinner with the team, telling her you’d have to work late, and that you’d have to chat over the weekend instead.

In reply, Dina had sent a photo of Ellie looking thoroughly sulky while holding a delighted JJ, who had smeared pumpkin puree all over her face and hair. You reacted with a *rolling on the floor laughing* emoji, and typed out a quick response of ‘*What we all wish we could to to Ellie every time she opens her mouth*,’ and appended a love heart underneath.

You swiped to your home screen, and you were setting an alarm for work in the morning when Abby returned from the bathroom. She was wiping her face with one end of the towel draped around her shoulders, and setting down a neat pile of her folded work clothes on the dresser with the other.

“What time is it, baby?” she asked, now hanging up the towel on a hook on the back of the bedroom door.

“Hm?” you responded, absent-mindedly. You looked up at her from your phone as she turned around.

You blinked a few times as you took in the sight of her.

Abby had stripped down to her black designer boxers, the thick waistband only *barely* concealing the blonde hair beneath them that you were becoming rather *satisfyingly*\-familiar with. Her peaked, barbelled nipples pointed at you from her small chest, and her hulking shoulders and biceps were on full display as she released her hair from its messy bun.

*Jesus fucking christ* she was stunning to look at.

But it was her *thighs* that you’d missed most of all: concealed beneath her trousers all evening, it had been *way* too long since you’d seen those meticulously sculpted legs.

Standing there, looking at you with her dirty blonde hair cascading over one shoulder, her perfectly-honed figure wearing nothing but those *very* well-fitting boxers—Abby looked like a literal *god*.

*Was that drool you could feel on your lip?*

You stared at her open-mouthed, oblivious to the questions she had asked.

“Hey,” she chortled, clicking her fingers in front of you to tear your attention from her chiseled torso to her bemused face.

“Huh?” you roused, shaking your head in surprise, realising all of a sudden that you’d been staring. You grimaced back at her a bit stupidly.

“The time?” she asked, grinning at you expectantly.

“Oh. It’s, uhhhh, 3:11,” you finally replied.

Abby shook her head at you and chuckled, grinning broadly. She actually looked pretty pleased to catch you staring.

She put her phone on silent on the side table, smirk broadening, and then she climbed into bed next to you.

While you finished setting your alarm, her hand immediately snuck beneath your sweater and found your waist as she pulled herself in close to you. She put her chin on your shoulder and looked up at you as you put your phone down.

“You’re so freaking cute. You know that, right?” she asked you in a tired voice.

You smiled, yawning at the same time. “Ohhh—*hank* you,” you garbled out through your enormous yawn, before scooching further down the bed until you were face to face with her.

You tucked yourself up against her chest, curling your legs into hers, and your hands under your chin. Abby tucked a strand of hair behind your ear affectionately, and you yawned again.

“*So* tired,” you said, looking at her as your eyes blinked slowly. You could barely keep them open.

Abby pressed a soft, sweet kiss to your lips, smiling the whole time, and allowing her mouth to linger on yours briefly.

“Mmm,” she hummed, and then squeezed your butt cheek playfully with her left hand. “Okay, roll over,” she commanded in her own gruff, equally sleepy voice, and she assertively pushed your body away from hers so you were facing the other direction.

You reached over to turn off the lamp, and then she pulled you firmly back into her embrace.

“Abby!” you whined, “Am I *always* gonna be the little spoon?” you huffed, but your hands belied your protest as your fingers moved to entwine with Abby’s, which were now beneath your sweater and resting against your stomach.

“Probably,” she mumbled in reply, unbothered by your half-assed sulking.

She nuzzled her face into the back of your hair, inhaling deeply, and then pressed a few small kisses to your neck before settling into the pillow behind you.

Her body nestled cozily up against you, and it felt heavenly to be wrapped up in her large frame, protected from the cool night air. Her perpetually-warm skin was so comforting, and you melted gladly into the sensation of her before falling into a heavy sleep.

You woke up the next morning to your phone vibrating on the bedside table with a new message alert.

“Hnnnngh.” Abby grumbled quietly in protest behind you and buried her face into your back, pulling the covers up over her head before wrapping her arms back around your stomach.

You stretched your arms out, an almighty yawn rising from you as you blinked your eyes slowly open. Morning light was filtering in between the curtains.

The bedroom felt cosy, the heater having done its work overnight.

Abby hitched one of her hulking thighs over your hip, and used it to pull you closer to her. She dusted a few lazy kisses over your shoulder blades, and then settled back down behind you, making cute snuffly noises as she attempted to go back to sleep.

*Zzzzzt! Zzzzzt!*

Your phone buzzed obnoxiously again.

“Hnnhhhh.” Abby grumbled again.

“Let me just—” and you reached over to the bedside table.

“Nnnnggghh!” Abby grunted at you as you pulled away from her.

“Why are you so sulky this morning?” you said, ignoring her protestations as you reached for your phone. The second it was in your grasp, Abby pulled your body effortlessly back into her embrace, and proceeded to make soft, sleeping noises into your back.

Five messages from Dina. You’d better check she was ok.

You opened your phone, and started reading.

*‘What are you doing up at 3:11 in the morning?’*

*‘You’re never up that early. Is everything ok?!’*

*‘Wait.’*

*‘WAIT!!!!!!’*

*‘WERe YOU jUST GETTIG TO BED At 3Am????’*

*‘IS IT THE LUMBERJACK?????’*

*‘DID YOUR FUCk TEH LUMBERJACK?’*

‘I SEE YOU READING THESE!!!! ANSWR mE FOR THE LOVEOF ALL THAT IS GOOD In THE WORDL!!’

You snorted with glee at the garbled mess of Dina’s hastily-typed words. She was probably nursing JJ while trying to fix Ellie breakfast at the same time as she was texting you.

But Dina’s texts could wait a little bit longer. Now you knew she was okay, you just wanted to return to the hulking mountain woman who was pawing at your waist as she pathetically, wordlessly, begged you to return your body to her.

You returned your phone to the side table and rolled over towards Abby.

You tucked your head under her chin and snuggled into her, as her large, warm hands encircled your back.

She tilted her head down and pressed a kiss to the bridge of your nose, and then to your forehead, before she settled her chin back upon your head, cocooning you safely in her embrace.

<h3>Chapter End Notes</h3>
<p>So look. I feel like I've promised y'all Abby in tennis shorts for the last few chapters, and I swear to god it's coming. I was having so much fun writing that epic smut for y'all, but I had to end it somewhere or this chapter would just go on forever.
Also coming up—Abby and Reader will be returning to the cabin with Bear and there'll be lots of cozy / hot times; and we'll be digging in to how Reader's planning for their exhibition is going. Lots of fun stuff on the horizon!
Thanks again for reading, and I really hope you enjoyed this chapter.
Every single one of your comments feeds a hungry paragraph, so please tell me what you think—or you can DM me on Tumblr at les-tigres-de-papier</p>

<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>“Wanna know why <em>else</em> I’m the best?” she asked, looking pleased with herself as she climbed into the bed again with her mug in one hand. She sat cross-legged, facing you.
“It’s it your thighs?” you whipped back at her without skipping a beat, using your free hand to firmly dig your fingers into the flesh of her leg. “Because, Abby—I’m already <em>well-acquainted</em> with your thighs,” you finished sounding like a know-it-all.
You took a tentative sip of tea to gauge the temperature of the steaming liquid, while your eyes peeked cheekily at her from over the rim of the mug.
She made a little snort.
“Pffft, dork.” Abby rolled her eyes at you, but you were sure you caught a hint of a proud smirk at the corner of her lips.
--
You wake up with Abby in your bed, thirst texts from Dina on your phone, and you still can't quite believe Abby wants to be with <em>you</em> after everything that happened.
But when you and Abby head to her place to relieve Bear's dogsitter, will your anxiety and your emotional hangovers from your time with the doctor sabotage things?</p>
<h3>Chapter Notes</h3>
<p>Heyyyyyyy my lovely fellow Abby stans! Welcome back! It's been a minute, huh? Bet you thought I'd forgotten all about this fic. I absolutely promise I'd never do that.
There's been a Pretty Big Thing going on for me in the last several months that has been keeping me busy: I HAD TOP SURGERYYYYY!
Obviously this is extremely very exciting, especially as I have been working towards for the last several years in particular, and been on a surgical waiting list for 13 months (and that's through private health; yes, the Australian 'healthcare' system is _also<em>a W I L D R I D E for trans/enby folks). I have had so much to do in the last few months, from a whole bunch of pre-op appointments, tests and psych stuff; figuring leave and announcements out with my workplace (who have been incredibly supportive, I'm really freaking lucky); and of course a metric fuckton of healthcare admin 🫠 in addition to all the usual stuff for my chronic health things. What a time!
As such, I have been in hardcore prioritisation mode, and something had to give, and unfortunately it was our thirst for Abby. I feel dirty saying that, and when I looked back today at when I posted the last chapter, let's just say that I was as shocked as you. 🥲 I have missed writing this so much and have felt an ache in my heart at having to put it on the back-burner.
Anyhoo, I'm 6 weeks post-op as of this week, all is healing well (hurrah!), and jfc not having boobs when you have despised having boobs for decades IS A WHOLE MOOD. I couldn't be happier, and I'm having daily gender euphoria moments.
I want to take this opportunity to say to all my fellow trans/enby bbs out there—I love you, I see you, hang in there, you can get through this and experience genderqueer and affirming joy, and it is absolutely worth the extremely difficult wait.
That little public service announcement aside—let's talk about this ficccccc!
I've been working on this chapter on and off when I've had spoons over the last few months. It's been challenging to work through the original narrative arc that I had planned, so I've been doing sooooo much stewing trying to find the best way to escalate this plot in a way that feels authentic to the characters. I haven't _totally</em> nailed it yet, but I've written things in such a way that it gives me a few places I can take this as I continue to figure it out.
When I started writing this chapter, I was like, "No smut here, all fluff and plot!" and so i wrote a bunch of good fluff with some light plot but then all of a sudden smut happened and before I knew it there was like 11,000+ words and I hadn't even gotten to the freaking long-awaited tennis shorts jfc what is wrong with me.
SO I decided to split the chapter in two parts.
That means *this* chapter is a fluffy, smut-free cute fest, with a tiny sprinkle of plot. A nice, warm, cozy reacquaintance with our dear Reader and our beloved Abby and her tanky arms. We also get to meet Lev, and I'm really happy with how he's turned out and I had lots of fun building off the relationship between them that Naughty Dog establishes in TLOU2.
The <em>next</em> chapter is about half-done. It will be some (already-written, pretty excellent IMHO) smut, some more narrative-building fluff and other bits of character insights I still have to write—and then for fuck's sake this long-awaited tennis match might actually happen, because WE (I?) JUST WANT ABBY IN TENNIS SHORTS ALREADY. (As an aside, this tennis match is of virtually no importance to the broader plot; I just really wanted to give Reader the opportunity to ogle Tennis Shorts Abby from the sidelines, so I've really made it into a whole thing that it's <em>actually not at all</em>—but you know, sometimes you just really decide you need to write a thing, I guess?!! 🤷‍♂️🤣).
⚠️ <strong>Some important content notes for this chapter:</strong> there is a very brief mention of Yara’s death, as well as a very brief mention of Lev and Yara's emotionally abusive ultra-religious parents and church (boooooo!). If that's a no go for you, this occurs in the last third (or thereabouts) of this chapter.
Okay. Enough preamble—I hope you enjoy cozy, fluffy Abby and Reader, with a side of Lev and a garnish of Dina thirst texts!</p>

You woke again as an incessant grumble hollered impatiently from within your stomach.

You figured you’d managed to steal another hour or so of sleep—enough that you didn’t want to totally die from exhaustion, but nowhere near enough to feel properly rested.

You blinked your weary eyes open for the second time that morning, and let out a yawn that was a little louder than you’d intended it to be.

You took a deep breath, letting it out slowly as you slowly came to your senses.

Abby’s hand rested against your abdomen, fingertips tucked possessively inside the waistband of your sleep shorts. Her feet were entwined with your own, just like they had the first morning you’d woken up next to her all those weeks ago.

You could hear Abby’s breathing, slow and soft, from behind your ear and took in the warmth of her skin pressed against your back, cocooning you cozily from the cool morning air.

You stretched and flexed your feet as a longer yawn escaped your lips.

“Hnnnngh…” A sleepy, gravelly grumble purred quietly in your ear. Abby pulled you closer to her so you were even more wrapped up in her warmth. She pressed soft kisses to your shoulder briefly before you felt her rouse, letting out a long, almost-silent yawn before nuzzling into your back again.

“Heyyyyy, sleepyhead,” you whispered, turning your head over your shoulder in her direction.

“Hmmmh.” She offered another tired grumble in response, but the hand at your abdomen smoothed gentle motions against your skin. You moved your hand to entwine your fingers with hers, and she pulled them higher up your body, coming to rest just below your sternum as she tugged you affectionately against her body again.

“Wha—time is it?” she croaked softly, mid-yawn.

“Hmmm, my alarm hasn’t gone off so I guess… before eight?”

“Hnnngh,” she huffed, displeased with this reality, “’m so tired,” she protested, tucking one leg in between your own, and sliding her muscular arm beneath your neck, pulling you closer so she was wrapped almost completely around you.

Damn, she felt *so* good encasing you with her limbs, and the heft of her thick body against you was sublime. Her warm, soft skin felt soothing against your own.

It was cute seeing Abby all smooshy and sleepy like this. You supposed it was unlikely many people had ever seen *this* version of her.

You sighed softly as she pressed more lazy kisses against your neck.

“Hmmm, can’t we just stay here all day instead of going to the office?” you whined, as Abby’s hands began to affectionately map out your body.

She chuckled quietly in your ear.

“How about… we go to the office, get today over and done with—,” her kisses dotted slowly from your neck to your shoulder, “—and I promise I’ll do my best not to drag you into that meeting room everyone hates without any windows and do indecent things to you—,” you somehow managed to groan in pleasure *and* chuckle at her indecent proposal at the same time, “—and then, you come spend the whole long weekend with me and Bear at the cabin?”

She’d managed to subtly rearrange her position so you were on your back, and she was now almost completely on top of you, continuing to dust your shoulders and neck casually with soft pecks. She used one arm to pull the cascade of long, blonde hair—now wavy after being freed overnight from her usual braid—over one shoulder, so it wouldn’t tickle your face.

Damn, she looked so good. How could she make combing her fingers through her hair so fucking sexy? You’d never really gotten into the whole long-haired muscle jock thing; but looking at Abby right now, blonde hair falling over one perfectly sculpted shoulder and a sleepy smoulder drawn across her features—you thought *mayyyyyybe* you could finally understand the appeal.

Maybe you’d just found the *right* muscle jock? Which was a hilarious thought to you, because never in your life had you expected you would ever be *this* into someone who looked like like, well, Abby. You were used to women who looked like her being singly-focussed, obnoxious to be around for extended periods of time, and pretty uninformed on topics outside of “fitness”. It was everything you loathed.

But Abby was anything other than uninformed. And yeah, if you were honest with yourself, she *could* be a *little* obnoxious at times—but it seemed *mostly* for show, she somehow managed to make the way she cocked that infuriating eyebrow of hers so damned sexy that it made your knees weak. And if she was singly focused—right now, she was singly focused on you.

Your heart thrummed in your chest at the thought, and you gulped away the emotion that overcame you in that fraction of a moment, hoping that Abby hadn’t noticed.

“Mmm… three whole days of just you and Bear in your cozy little remote cabin? Whatever will we do to keep ourselves entertained?” you mused.

“Well, if Owen has worked it out with Nora, it’ll be *five* whole days, actually,” she said, raising her eyebrows.

“Ooooh, talk dirty to me, Anderson,” you cooed playfully.

Abby smirked that rakish grin at you and planted a slow kiss to your mouth, before pulling back while biting her lip and making the most sultry goddamned face at you.

“Okay. I’m gonna start getting ready,” she said, pulling away from you with raised eyebrows.

You bit your lip in reply as you lay there, watching pathetically as she perched herself on her knees atop the mattress, her tight black boxers rumpled up on one thigh from sleep, while she pulled the hair tie from her wrist and haphazardly fastened her blond hair into a messy bun on the back of her head.

“Nooooo, come back!” you whined, a little pathetically, your hand reaching out for her.

She merely shook her head and gave you another rakish grin.

“Uh-uh,” she said, grabbing her phone and slipping it into the waistband of her boxers at her hip, which was somehow so casually hot—*what the actual fuck?!!*

“I’mma make coffee,” she drawled through a yawn, “Want some tea? Still can’t believe you drink *tea*,” she sniggered, rolling her eyes.

“Hey, I can’t help it that I’m more refined than you,” you sassed her.

“Blah blah blah,” she teased, and you hurled a pillow at her.

“You’re a ass sometimes, Anderson—you know that don’t you?” you chastised, but it was hard not to find her cheek in this moment adorable.

“Heh, yeah, Manny tells me every day,” she called loftily over her shoulder, as her fine-as-hell butt walked out of the room, the soft thud of her giant feet on the floorboards trailing away behind her.

Without Abby in the bed, you suddenly felt cold again. You pulled the blankets up to your chin and grabbed your phone from the side table. You texted back the gallery owner to let them know what times you could chat today, and then opened your messages from Dina and reread them.

*‘WAIT!!!!!!’*

*‘WERe YOU jUST GETTIG TO BED At 3Am????’*

*‘IS IT THE LUMBERJACK?????’*

*‘DID YOUR FUCk TEH LUMBERJACK?’*

‘I SEE YOU READING THESE!!!! ANSWR mE FOR THE LOVEOF ALL THAT IS GOOD In THE WORDL!!’

You laughed, fingers hovering over the keyboard as you thought about how to respond.

“I can neither confirm nor deny these rumours,” you decided upon.

The three dots appeared almost immediately, telling you she was replying, and a few seconds later—

“BULLSHIT. Is she still there? Is that why you won’t confirm?”

And then—

“DID YOU BONE ANDERSON IN ELLIE’S FAMILY’S SPARE BEDROOM?!! PLEASE PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY!!”

You laughed audibly.

“I did not bone Abby in the spare room,” you sent back.

“Yet.” you added a few seconds later, appending a grimacing emoji for dramatic effect.

“HAH! But you banged her SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?!!”

You paused and bit your lip. God you loved Dina. You both certainly had *a type*.

“Omg ok ok yes, we had hot AF office sex. And FUCK, D—it was *so* hot. I swear to god I didn’t know I was *capable* of being that wet,” you mashed out with your fingers, blushing at the memory.

“HELLS YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!” Dina’s reply read, accompanied by a thousand thirsty emojis that made you laugh.

“OMG. I’m so happy/jealous. Damn you are the luckiest human ever to walk the face of this earth,” she continued.

You responded with the sass emoji and a smirking face.

“How were the arms? Are the arms still beefcake?”

“Oh, I can absolutely guarantee you those arms remain utter perfection.”

Dina responded with three drooling emojis.

“I wanna hear all about it. You free later?” she prodded.

“Can’t til tonight. Work,” you replied with the disappointed emoji.

“Ughh, that sucks. We have a thing on tonight, one of the guys from Ellie’s band has a birthday party or something.” You could almost hear Dina’s resigned sigh from across the country. “Like at least we aren’t the only ones with kids anymore, but like. FFS. If she gets wasted again and I’m stuck doing all the diaper changes all night, she’s sleeping on the goddamned couch.”

You sent her a heart emoji in sympathy.

“Tomorrow, then?”

“Yeahhh tomorrow works. I *guess* I can wait til then.” Dina punctuated her message with an eye roll emoji and you laughed again.

You heard Abby’s footfalls on the stairs, which meant tea was incoming.

“Love you, D,” you mashed out in reply, and then gleefully set your phone down as Abby appeared in the doorway, naked from the waist up, a mismatched mug in each hand.

This was your idea of porn. A thick-thighed woman in tight black boxers that left little to the imagination holding warm drinks in front of her perfectly-toned body.

You bit your lip, and arranged the pillows behind you so you could sit upright, doing the same for Abby’s side of the bed. Abby passed one of the mugs over to you, and you grabbed the handle, cradling the mug lovingly between both palms.

“Oh my *god*, you’re the best,” you said, and she threw another charming smirk at you by way of response.

“Wanna know why *else* I’m the best?” she asked, looking pleased with herself as she climbed into the bed again with her mug in one hand. She sat cross-legged, facing you.

“It’s it your thighs?” you whipped back at her without skipping a beat, using your free hand to firmly dig your fingers into the flesh of her leg. “Because, Abby—I’m already *well-acquainted* with your thighs,” you finished sounding like a know-it-all.

You took a tentative sip of tea to gauge the temperature of the steaming liquid, while your eyes peeked cheekily at her from over the rim of the mug.

She made a little snort.

“Pffft, dork.” Abby rolled her eyes at you, but you were sure you caught a hint of a proud smirk at the corner of her lips. “The *actual* reason I’m amazing,” she continued haughtily, “is that I messaged Owen while I was waiting for the coffee to brew, and…” she paused for effect and flashed her teeth at you again, “*we* don’t have to work today.” She cocked her eyebrows at you.

“Ohmygodareyoufuckingserious?” you garbled in surprise, almost spilling the hot tea all over the bed, but then levelling out the mug just in time.

“Mmmhmm,” Abby nodded, pleased with herself.

“Isaac was fine with the changes, and told Owen he has everything he needs for today. So Owen profusely apologised that we had to work so late—“ you let loose a knowing smirk at that— “and apparently Nora told us to take the day to rest.”

“So that means…” you looked at Abby, the joyful realisation dawning on your face.

“Yuhuh,” she smirked, pleased, “Six day weekend.”

“Fuck. You’re a dreamboat. Did anyone ever tell you that? Actually forget about it, I already know that like at least 100 people have probably told you that in the last week or whatever,” you tried to correct yourself, already knowing it would go to her head—and *there* was that smug look again, accompanied by the smuggest of eyebrow raises.

“Oh. I meant to ask though. Would it be ok if we stay at my place tonight? Bear's sitter slept over last night, so I need to get home. Plus I forgot about that stupid fucking tennis thing tomorrow with Manny.” She narrowed her eyes in annoyance.

Bear's sitter sleeps over? That was... unexpected. You brushed it off.

“Ughhh, *spornts*?” you sulked, making a face. “I mean, *yay you* and all—,” you made a half-hearted effort at an encouragement face, and twirled an index finger as if you were waving a tiny, unenthusiastic flag, “—it’s just not really my *thing,*” you finished with a not-especially-convincing apologetic smile.

“Tell you what. You don’t *have* to come to the tennis. But while I drink my coffee, and you drink your—*sad leaf-water*,” she gestured at your mug derisively with her hand, “how about I find some photos of me in the tennis shorts I usually wear.” Abby looked at you nonchalantly, and your eyes widened.

”Gulp. Yes please,” you said urgently, biting your lip.

“Did you just say ‘*gulp*’ *out loud*…?” she teased, eyebrow furrowed in bemusement and a curious grin on her face.

You merely shrugged back with a smile in reply.

“You are *such* a dork,” she smirked.

As you finished your tea, you contemplated what Abby had said about Bear's sitter. You were *sure* Abby had said she lived alone. But you guessed maybe it made sense that a dogsitter sleeps over when someone works late as often as Abby does.

You were probably just being weird and paranoid. *Not everyone is cagey and deceptive like the doctor*, you reminded yourself inwardly. It's something you'd had to work through with your therapist *a lot* after all the bullshit the doctor had put you through.

*You can trust Abby. The doctor never displayed the kind of emotional vulnerability that Abby showed you last night.*

You nodded thoughtfully to yourself as you took a big sip of your tea.

*Yeah. Abby is nothing like her*, you reassured yourself. *Abby is different.*

You smiled and looked at the woman dreamily sipping coffee in the bed next to you as she scrolled through what looked like the stock market on her phone.

She caught you looking at her and leaned over to kiss you on your shoulder, being careful not to bump your steaming mug of tea.

*See, brain? Different.*

About an hour and a half later, you’d both managed to make it downstairs for breakfast. Abby spent the whole time in the shower distracting you by pressing you up against the tiles to make out with you, and it was *reaaaaally* hard to resist. The warm water running down your bodies felt so comforting after barely any sleep, and Abby’s perfectly plump lower lip made your stomach do flips with each kiss she pressed to your wet skin. She was handsy and playful the whole damn time, pretending to let you wash yourself before you’d find her mouth on you again, or her grabbing a handful of your ass and nudging her knee between the apex of your thighs. It was no surprise the hot water ran out after thirty minutes, and the bathroom was all steamy when you emerged.

You’d packed a weekender bag, including a little cache of art supplies, and finally extricated yourself from the cozy bedroom to drag your butt downstairs to the kitchen.

When you arrived downstairs, Abby was cobbling together breakfast of scrambled eggs on buttery toast, doing her best to navigate the unfamiliar cupboards to find what she needed. She had even set the table.

She was back in the clothes she’d worn to the office yesterday, the sleeves of her heavily-creased business shirt rolled up to the elbows as she prepared breakfast. She’d swept her hair back into that messy bun you adored after you’d showered, but strands of her blonde hair had already escaped the hair tie.

She looked sexy as hell, and her outfit made you think salacious thoughts of everything that had transpired less than 12 hours ago, and you felt a swooping feeling in your abdomen and between your thighs.

Steeling yourself, you sat at the big, old wooden kitchen table. It had been a long time since someone had cooked you breakfast—god *knows* the doctor *‘never had the time’*—and in your utterly exhausted state, it was a gesture so sweet that you couldn’t help but feel a flush of warmth in your cheeks and a little fluttery pang in your chest.

She looked so dreamy.

*This woman wants to date me? What is going on in the world right now?*

You resolved not to question things too hard, and just enjoy it all for now; the anxiety could come later.

After breakfast, you both headed out to her Jeep, which was crusted in places with small patches of melting ice from the cool change overnight.

“Snow’s predicted on the mountain Saturday night,” she noted, as you both climbed into the car.

“Mmm I love first snow,” you beamed, your eyes crinkling. “The pines look so pretty all sprinkled with snow—like they’re covered in powdered sugar.” You grinned a dreamy, satisfied grin, and closed your eyes, imagining the snowflakes dusting the trees.

Abby caught sight of your expression and a hint of crimson flashed in her cheeks, eyelids fluttering almost shyly as though she’d stumbled upon the sweetest sight she’d ever seen. She looked away when she saw you’d noticed her expression, started the engine, and pulled her wayfarers from an overhead compartment and donned them. She looked handsome as hell in her suit and sunglasses.

The car was freezing, having sat out in the cold overnight. You rubbed your hands together to warm them up.

“Oh, babe—you cold?” she asked, concerned.

“Yeah,” you grimaced, through clenched teeth, “Left my mittens at my cabin. I don’t have any here with me,” you said with a wince.

“Here,” Abby cranked up the heating and pulled your hands into her own, enveloping them warmly and breathing hot air onto them.

“Your hands are like *ice* babe,” she said, rubbing them for friction to help warm them up.

“I have crappy circulation. This *always* happens,” you sighed. “Good thing you’re perpetually hot.”

You hadn’t meant it *that* way—but Abby smirked, and turned your way nonetheless to look over the rims of her sunglasses, those blue eyes burning into you.

You rolled your eyes at her. “Ugh. Not how I meant it. You’re insufferable, Anderson,” you muttered with a reluctant grin.

She shrugged, and smirked at you, and then turned her head over her shoulder to back the car out of the driveway, her hand on the back of your seat as she craned to watch for a large oak tree in her blind spot.

About twenty minutes later, you’d pulled into the parking garage at Abby’s apartment complex in a fancy, new-looking building a few suburbs over from the Williams’s place. Abby grabbed your her laptop sleeve and suit jacket with one hand, and grabbed the handles of your weekender with the other, leading you towards the elevators.

Your stomach was churning, and you couldn’t figure out why. Were you feeling confused about who this dogsitter was who stayed over at Abby’s house?

“So… what’s the deal with Bear’s sitter? They just—stay over all the time?” you started, as you got into the elevator. You didn’t *think* Abby was being deliberately cagey, but it all seemed a bit... strange.

“Yeah—Lev stays in the guest room a lot.” She pressed the button for level three, and the doors closed behind her.

“Huh. So, he’s like… a *roommate*?” you asked.

“Nah, just a friend.”

Were you about to walk into some awkward 'roommate who doesn’t actually live here but never leaves the two of you alone' kinda situation?&nbsp;Why would Abby of all people put up with something like that?

*Ugh! You’re being weird*, you chided yourself.

Why was this bothering you so much? Why were you making such a big deal out it in your head when it was probably nothing?!

You tried to swat away all the questions, and suppress the puzzlement that was trying to force its way onto your features.

*Neutral face. NEUTRAL FACE!!!* you urged yourself.

“How do you two know each other?”

You attempted to sound just *casually* interested in her answer.

Was this Lev guy some dude who had a crush on Abby and was going to get all defensive the second he became aware of your newly-emerging… what was this? A relationship? Dating?

Oh god. Did you have to have *that* discussion now, too?!

You could feel a mild panic creeping in.

*I hate meeting new people*, you thought to yourself.

“Huh..?” Abby asked, looking confused. The lift stopped, and dinged as the doors opened.

She stepped out of the elevator.

“OH! No. No! Fuck, did I say that out loud? Oh my god…” you tried to apologise and explain all at once, but your words came out all jumbled.

*Control-z! CONTROL-Z!!!!!*

The elevator doors tried to close with you still in the lift, and she stuck her arm out to stop them. You hurried out of the lift and sighed heavily, your shoulders falling in frustration. Why were you feeling so anxious all of a sudden?

Had you just insulted her? Or this Lev person? You hadn’t meant it that way! Why did your brain have to be so unhelpful?!

You were mortified.

Abby was looking at you, a little taken aback. You were both standing in front the elevator.

“Are you okay…?” she asked, eyebrows furrowed.

“I just… ugh. I’m sorry. I’m *so bad* at this. When I’m at work, I can just… it’s like there’s a switch that goes on and I can just be some kind of… professional version of myself,” you tried to explain, looking anywhere but at Abby.

She looked back at you saying nothing, lips pressed together and an unreadable look on her face.

You sighed heavily again.

“But socially…” you continued explaining, “I just… I get… *really* anxious meeting new people. Ugh, this is so embarrassing. I guess I didn’t realise I was anxious until just now.”

*I HATE THIS,* your brain screamed.

You closed your eyes, wishing you could just erase this whole conversation and run away and hide.

“Oh. *Oh*. Is that… *it*?” she faltered, tilting her head to the side in bemusement, and then, she let out a small, apologetic laugh. “I’m sorry—I *meant*,” she clarified with a kind smile, setting down your overnighter and grabbing one of your hands in hers, “I *meant*, thanks for telling me that. Lev’s… kinda like… a kid brother to me, I guess. People have been… a bit weird about it in the past. Sorry if I was a bit… I don’t know… *vague* about it or whatever,” she finished with a grimace.

You were still avoiding her gaze.

How was she this great, though? Didn’t she think you were annoying for having had a panic attack while riding the elevator?

“Hey,” she said softly, moving closer to you and trying to get your attention. She squeezed your hand and moved the other to your chin, thumb swiping softly against it. “Hey—it’s *okay*. *Really*. Manny has anxiety, too.” Your face must’ve betrayed your surprise, and she nodded. “You’d never know half the time because he’s all *Mr Suave-In-A-Suit-And-Overflowing-With-Self-Confidence* on the surface, but yeah. That guy *loves* an inconveniently-timed panic attack. Not that there's ever a *convenient* time to have a panic attack,” she smirked.

You finally looked back at her. Her features had softened completely. She must have noticed the angst-ridden look on your face, because she smirked and uttered a little, “*Really*. It’s *fine*,” and pulled you into a hug.

“Anything I can do to help?” she asked. “Do you, like, just wanna hang out here in front of the elevator for the day?” she joked, pulling back from you to show you she was fine. “We can make it a whole thing. I’ll get snacks!”

“No,” you bit your lip, trying to repress a grin, and shook your head.

A tiny laugh escaped you: she was being really freaking sweet and you, meanwhile, would prefer to not be perceived.

“If you wanna come in—Lev is cool, I promise. He was a freshman on the baseball team at Harvard the year I graduated. He’s just a nerdy queer kid with too much attitude and awkward social skills. But he’s one of our people. He’s great,” she reassured you. “So… wanna head in?” she asked finally, gesturing towards the hallway.

You scrunched up your face. “Yeahhhh,” you nodded, taking a deep breath to calm yourself. “Hey, Abby—?”

“Hm?” she responded looking back at you with raised eyebrows, her other hand now grasping the handles of your overnighter.

“Thankyou. For understanding. Sorry for being a bit…”

She shook her head gently, smiling, as if to say, ‘don’t worry about it,’ and gestured towards her apartment.

She waved a fob of some kind against her front door and you heard it click open. She was still telling you about Lev as she crossed the threshold.

“So when we were in college, Lev was in the batting cages a lot at the same time as me. He was an amazing pitcher, but he sucked something *awful* at hitting. So… I taught him how to hit properly,” she finished matter-of-factly.

“Yeahhhh, and I still suck at hitting, so, no thanks to you,” a taunting, youthful voice called from the kitchen.

All of a sudden, excited barks sounded from a hallway towards the back of the room, accompanied by the sound of furiously-scampering feet on floorboards.

Bear was immediately all over Abby, a flurry of enthusiastic licks and jumps, and then he immediately turned to you to do the same.

“Heyyyy Bear! Oh my gosh—I missed you too!” you said, giving him scritches all over his fluffy neck and head as he licked furiously at your hand and danced about your feet. Despite being a huge black german shepherd, he had the personality of a puppy.

“Jeez, *down* Bear!” Abby chided him with a grin, as she kicked off her shoes and set them neatly on a stylish rack beside the front door next to several other pairs of expensive-looking leather business shoes, athletic trainers, smart-casual leather sneakers, and a *very* appealing pair of large Timberland workboots. Some ratty black, well-loved Converse All-Stars that looked too small to be Abby’s were strewn across the entryway alongside a pair of greying athletic tube socks. Abby made quick work of neatening them up before moving beyond the threshold.

Bear was thoroughly impressed to see you, leaning his full body into your side so you could scratch his flanks and tummy.

“Bear, *really*?” she scolded him, eyebrows raised, but Bear just looked up at you with his gorgeous eyes like you were his best friend in the whole world. Abby scoffed. “Sorry, he’s *never* like this, except for with Lev,” she mumbled apologetically.

“He’s fine—honestly,” you said, mussing your fingers into the fur behind his ears. “I guess he missed me as much as I missed him.”

You cocked your head to one side and flashed Abby a sweet smile, and she had to bite her lip to try and hold back the broad grin that crept on to her face. You could’ve sworn you saw crimson flush her cheeks again as she turned away to put down your weekender on the sofa, and then extricated her keys and wallet from her pockets and set them down in a neat little dish on a small, mid-century modern oak sidetable near the entryway.

“Bear, come!” Abby’s command was accompanied by a sharp snap of her fingers, and Bear was immediately at her side, giving you space to set down your other bag.

You followed suit and removed your sneakers, placing them neatly next to the shoe rack before walking towards the kitchen where Lev and Abby were.

“Lev, this is—”

“The… designer, right?” Lev gave you an awkward wave as he poured cereal into a bowl. “Hey, I’m Lev. Abby won’t shut up about you. Want coffee?”

You felt your cheeks grow hot, and caught Abby throwing a steely glare Lev’s way.

“*What…?*” he huffed at her sheepishly under his breath.

*Abby won’t shut up about you?*

“It’s great to meet you, Lev,” you smiled. “Got any tea?” you asked hopefully.

Lev made a bemused face at you that was uncannily similar to the same face Abby made when *she* was puzzled: slightly taken aback, brows furrowed seriously, and a not-quite-smirk at the corner of his lips. He turned towards Abby who made the exact same face back at him and then shrugged. You watched them in this silent exchange. Despite looking nothing alike—Lev was lanky and short for his age, with a messy mop of straight black hair—their shared mannerisms were hard to miss.

“*Tea*, huh? Ohhhhhkay,” Lev responded with the simultaneous angst and ridicule only a bratty college kid could muster. “Lemme see what I can find,” he huffed with a derisive little smirk.

He began searching the kitchen, opening drawers and cupboards. Abby, meanwhile, disappeared down one of the hallways with your weekender, suit jacket folded over her shoulder and Bear following close behind.

You took a moment to regard the living room, which was as stylish and thoughtfully-composed as Abby’s cabin in the mountains. An enormous wall-mounted TV sat on the wall opposite the kitchen, surrounded by a low, grey lounge setting arranged in a u-shape. A round oak coffee table that matched the small table by the front door was positioned in the middle of the sofas, atop a soft-looking plush beige rug. There was a six-seater dining table—again, oak, with low-backed Scandinavian wood dining chairs surrounding it—on the far side of the room. The sizeable kitchen was hidden behind a large island bench with three black designer stools tucked in beneath a marble countertop. A few oil paintings and photos in wooden frames adorned the walls, and on a low cabinet behind the lounge lay a thoughtfully-composed assortment of knick-knacks and a framed photo of what looked to be a teenaged Abby—a navy Red Sox baseball cap on her head, wearing a cheesy grin, teeth bejewelled by braces—with her arms wrapped around the shoulder of a kind-faced man with short, brown hair.

Her dad, presumedly.

This younger Abby looked so carefree, so at ease. You saw this expression on her face only a few times. More often than not, though, her brows furrowed seriously and her smile didn’t come easily, or at least—not the smile you could see in this photo. There was a the ‘Abby doing a great job winning over Isaac’ kind of smile. There was the rakish grin she’d worn often when it was just the two of you.

But this easy, joyful, dorky smile? Had you *ever* seen it? Maybe *briefly* in the car, the morning after you first met her when she was driving you to the Williams’ cabin? You couldn’t be sure, though, and that was probably just wishful thinking… right?

Bear returned, alerting you and Lev to his presence with a small *ruff*, and Abby followed close behind. She was now in comfy grey sweatpants and a long-sleeved crimson Harvard baseball sweater, sleeves pushed up to her elbows.

*Damn*, she looked good in… well, *everything* she seemed to wear.

“How’s school?” Abby asked Lev as she joined him in the kitchen.

“Fine,” Lev responded, with disdain that was suitably befitting of a typical, disaffected college student.

“What does ‘*fine*’ mean? Did something happen at baseball?” Abby sounded like an annoying older sibling fussing over him.

“It’s *fiiiiine*,” Lev insisted, as he continued to rifle through various drawers and cupboards on the hunt for tea. But when Abby gave him *a look*, Lev rolled his eyes, huffed, and then let out a big sigh.

“It’s—it’s nothing. *Really*,” but when Abby’s eyes bore into his reproachfully, he made a face before he continued. “Ugh. It’s just—it’s my shoulder thing is playing up again and I think they’re gonna start Moline next week for the exhibition game at Yale.”

“But you’ve been doing your exercises… *right*?” Abby said, emphasising the last word with eyebrows raised at him. She withdrew some strawberries and blueberries from the fridge, and gestured with the punnets in your direction. You nodded, and she took them to the sink to rinse them and then started cutting up the strawberries on a chopping board.

“Lev. *Exercises*?” she repeated, trying to get his attention.

“Huh? Oh. Yeah… well. *Mostly*… I guess…” Lev mumbled, voice dying off sheepishly as he buried his head in the pantry.

“Dude.” Abby said, now getting in the way of Lev, stooping her much-taller frame so she could look him in the eyes in an ‘concerned older sibling’ kind of way. “The physio said you *have* to do the exercises *every day*. Remember? Hey!” She snapped her fingers in front of his face and Lev swatted them out the way with his small hands.

“*Stooooop*. It’s *fine*,” Lev sulked, avoiding Abby’s gaze as he emerged from the pantry and dodged under Abby’s arm as he moved towards the kettle.

“Lev, what did she tell you?” she pushed, returning to the berries.

“I don’t… it’s like—*ugh*.” He glared at Abby with an annoyed look. He took a deep breath, and sighed, resignedly. “She saaaaaid, I have to do them every day even though I don’t think it does anything, and I’ll be fine by pre-season,” he mumbled at her in a slightly mocking voice.

“Exactly. Sooooo… what are you gonna do?” she said expectantly.

Lev mumbled something under his breath.

“Huh? D’you say something? Can’t hear you,” Abby asked with a smirk, mussing up his scruffy black hair with her enormous hands.

“Ugh. *Abbbyyyy*.” Lev swatted her hands away again, and put a teabag into a beautifully-glazed earthenware mug. He rearranged his hair in a way that was… slightly differently-mussed?

You pressed your lips together to repress a smirk.

“Sorry,” Abby said apologetically, giving him a kind look.

“You suck.”

She just glared at him, an expectant look on her face, saying nothing.

“Ugh. Fiiiiine!” he whined, “I’ll do them every day, then. *Happy* now?” The kettle beeped behind him, and he turned around in a huff to fetch it—but you caught Lev smirking sheepishly when Abby was out of sight.

“Yes, actually. I’m very happy to hear you’re taking care of your wellbeing, thanks for asking, Lev!” she said in a chipper voice that you were sure would drive Lev nuts.

“You still suck though, just saying,” he mumbled, sassing her as he poured the water into the mug for you.

“Yeah, yeah, so you keep telling me,” she chuckled, scraping the strawberries into two bowls with the knife, and grabbing a fork for each of you. She flashed a small, knowing smile at you that Lev definitely missed.

You suppressed a giggle. Abby and Lev’s banter was clearly \*well-\*established.

Lev brought your tea and his own cup of coffee to the dining table before returning to the bench to grab the bowl of cereal and a coffee for Abby.

“Thanks, Lev.”

“No problem,” he replied.

“So what are you studying?” you asked him when he returned to sit at the table, falling into a chair opposite you, and immediately scooping up a spoonful of milky cereal and crunching on it enthusiastically.

Abby set down a hand-thrown earthenware bowl of berries in front of you, and then sat in the chair on the other side of the table next to Lev with her own bowl, and started eating the berries in large forkfuls that somewhat-mirrored Lev’s inhalation of cereal—though her mouthfuls were certainly more graceful.

“Ummm… Arts right now,” he said between mouthfuls, “Buuuut I’m thinking of doing… ummm, astrophysics.” His voice was a shy mumble as if he hadn’t convinced *himself* he even *wanted* to do it yet. He crammed more cereal hungrily into his mouth, an uncertain look on his face.

“Whoa, that’s kinda cool actually. Why astrophysics?”

He gulped down his mouthful. “Well, I… I just really like science, I guess? I didn’t get to do any science until…” he glanced at Abby questioningly, as if checking what information she had shared with you about him. She gently shook her head and smiled kindly, and he looked down at his cereal before continuing, like he was deciding what he wanted to say.

“Uhhh, well, my parents. They were kindof. Conservative?” he looked down at his cereal bowl again, but he wasn’t ashamed; more tired, perhaps? Like it was a story he’d told before, but didn’t particularly enjoy recounting.

“Oh, I didn’t mean to pry, Lev—” you said gently, raising your hands apologetically to suggest he should only tell you what he was comfy with.

He glanced at Abby fondly, whose face was turned to the cereal bowl as she tried to catch four or five non-compliant blueberries with the tines of her fork.

“It’s—fine,” he let out a slow sigh, and then looked up at you. “We… they were, like, ultra-religious. Me and my sister. We—left when I was fourteen. So like, yeah. No *real* school til then, and then—it sucked a lot. Not just getting used to being at school, I mean,” he explained. “*They* sucked a lot. My parents. And the other people in our church. Like, learning what was actually real and what wasn’t. Was like, hard. After so long. And then my sister… she died. Just before I started college.” He looked at you ruefully, his eyes meeting yours fleetingly before he looked away. “I miss her,” he added simply, in a tone that was sad, but composed.

Abby looked at him silently, and raised her eyebrows at him. He met her eyes, and made a sort of shrug in her direction, as if signalling he was ok.

*This poor fucking guy.*

“Lev… I’m *so* sorry to hear that things have been so difficult for you. That’s a *lot* to go through. Thanks for sharing that with me,” you said earnestly, trying your best to make sure your expression was sincere and kind, but not pitiful. “My mom is religious, too. We don’t get along. I haven’t seen her in… a while. And yeah: it really sucks.”

Lev looked at you in surprise at first, and then nodded understandingly.

Abby looked at you, too, brows furrowed with concern, surprised this was the first time she was hearing this.

Across the table, you gave her a reassuring look and the same sort of small, resigned shrug that Lev had given her a moment ago. “I’ve been on my own for a long time now, and I’m used to taking care of myself. And things are *much* better when my mom isn’t in my life.” You made an uncomfortable chuckle, and looked at Lev. He nodded knowingly, and chuckled back, giving you an appreciative smile.

“Yeahhhh, I feel *that*,” Lev sighed, shaking his head and finally returning to his cereal, glancing up at you shyly every now and then.

“So no school til you were fourteen? That’s tough. Why are you thinking of changing from arts to science now? Arts are *cool*.” You smiled playfully at him.

“The evidence,” he smirked, and flashed you a knowing smile.

“Why *astrophysics* though?”

“Because space is freaking *cool*, obviously.” He playfully rolled his eyes at you.

“Hah. That’s true. Space is very cool.” You chuckled back.

“Plus: it’s just… *science*, y’know? Like, after so long of not knowing what’s real and what’s not… well—astrophysics has a bunch of that *too*, I guess—except the point is trying to *figure out* what’s real and what’s not based on evidence and proving the theories and stuff. Not just like, needing to accept things because people *say* it’s how it is.” He paused and rolled his eyes again. “So yeah. Astrophysics.”

“Hmm, yeah, makes sense. I just *personally* can’t imagine… all the numbers and equations and whatever,” you laughed at yourself. “Let’s just say that I’ve just *always* been much better with pictures and making stuff with my hands, I guess.”

Lev nodded at you. “Like what?”

“I do printmaking—when I’m not doing design, I mean,” you replied.

“Huh. Printmaking.” Lev considered this. “Sounds cool. And there’s, like, lots of maths and science stuff in art. Like the golden ratio.”

That sounded *vaguely* familiar—like something you’d probably learned in art school but completely forgotten in the intervening years. “Remind me what the golden ratio is…?” you prompted him.

“Oh it’s awesome and it appears, like, everywhere in nature and design and stuff,” and he sounded really excited all of a sudden. “It’s like this ratio between numbers that equals around, like… 1.618, I think? Kinda like the Fibonacci sequence. I actually learned about it in an industrial design elective…”

And so Lev infodumped all about the Golden Ratio in between spoonfuls of cereal and it was actually really interesting. You asked him to send you something about it and he told you he’d text something to Abby that she could share with you.

You caught Abby making cute little smirks out of Lev’s line of sight from time to time as you two chatted. It was definitely sweet, like she was proud of him—and it endeared her to you even more. They were a cute little found family.

Abby’s phone buzzed all of a sudden, and Lev looked up at her.

“S’Manny,” she garbled, standing with mouth full of strawberries, and indicating she’d take it in another room, “I’ll say hi for you,” and Lev nodded, and then turned back to you.

“So… what kind of… art do you make? Or prints, or whatever? Is it, like, screen prints?” Lev asked.

“I make prints using Japanese woodblock techniques—but they’re mostly abstract, and mostly inspired by nature.”

“What’s… Japanese woodblock? D’you have photos?” Lev asked, brows furrowed thoughtfully, like he was flicking through catalogues in his mind trying to figure out what this might mean.

“Sure, ummm,” you pulled out your phone and did a search for ‘ukiyo-e’ in your browser, sliding the phone across the table to him when you’d loaded up the image search results.

Lev crammed a spoonful of soggy cereal into his mouth, and you resumed with your bowl of berries while he swiped through photos.

“This one one with the skeleton is \*\*so metal…” he murmured, impressed.

“Yeah, heh, I guess it is. It’s from the mid-1800s.”

“Seriously? Whoa. Japanese artists in the 1800s were badass, then.”

“My stuff looks nothing like that though,” you added.

“Oh.” Lev sounded mildly disappointed, but then said eagerly—“Can I see?” and he slid your phone back across the table towards you, looking at you hopefully.

“Sure, yeah, okay, of course,” and you picked it up and started flicking through your photos for the album of your work. “There’s lots of stuff here, some of it is just sketches or works in progress,” you said, passing the phone back to him.

He swiped through them, a range of curious expressions passing across his features.

“This one is really cool, the pattern you’ve used for the… uh, is it tree bark…?” and you nodded at him, “It looks… nice,” he said, and his tone was a little shy, like he was embarrassed he didn’t have the appropriate vocabulary to express what he was trying to say. “This one with the leaves… they look kindof like they’re arranged in a fractal…” he pondered.

“Huh, yeah, I guess it does. Never noticed that before,” you thought, and Lev looked pleased with himself.

“Have you, like… had any of them in a gallery, or…?” Lev said, head still bent over the phone as he swiped through sketches and test prints.

“I’m trying to organise my first exhibition at the moment.”

“That’s cool. I’d probably go,” he said nonchalantly, looking up at you earnestly.

“Thanks, Lev. Want me to get Abby to share the invite with you when I’m done organising it?”

“Yeah. Cool. I don’t have to like, wear a suit, do I?”

“Hah, no, you don’t.”

“Awesome. I always feel so, like… suffocated in those,” and he scrunched up his features in distaste as he passed your phone back to you.

You smiled. Lev was great. Endearingly awkward at times, sure; but kinda punk and nerdy and sweet all at once. He was hard not to like.

You’d always gotten along well with nerds. You felt safe with them.

Abby’s voice emerged from around a corner.

Speaking of nerds you felt safe with…

“Yeah, well, tell Doug he can fucking wait, because I’m *not* working today. We were there until way too late last night,” she was saying tersely into her phone. “I don’t *care* if he needs a favour. His shitty planning is not my responsibility. I told him to get the models to me on Wednesday. It’s now Friday. Not my problem.”

Abby was practically bristling, her growing temper evident as her upper lip curled in frustration with whatever her and Manny were discussing. From everything you’d heard from *everyone* since you started contracting at FFL&Y, this Doug guy seemed like a real douchebag.

You could hear Manny’s voice on the other end of the phone as he responded to her.

“Yeah I know… sorry, Manny, I know it’s not on you. I’m just so *sick* of Doug and Nora getting *you* to ask me to do this shit. It’s manipulative as hell. They know if they ask me themselves there’s no way I’ll do it, so they ask you instead. They can wait til next week. I’m fucking *exhausted*,” she finished quietly.

Manny’s voice said something and you heard a laugh coming through the phone. “I—fuck you, asshole,” Abby said, but she looked temporarily scandalised and her cheeks flushed red, as riotous laugher from Manny continued.

More chatter from Manny, and then—“Yeah I’m coming, I’m coming, you’re a fucking pain in my ass,” she sighed, resigned. “What time do we need to meet you there? And please, *please* tell me it’s *not* at the country club on the other side of the city…? Oh thank *fuck*,” and Abby shook her head, relieved in response to whatever Manny had said. “Yeah, cool. We’ll see you there at nine then… pfft, shut up, Manny,” she added in response to whatever he’d said, before finishing the call with a resigned sigh.

“Manny says hi, and he wanted you to know you could come to the tennis thing tomorrow if you want,” Abby offered Lev.

“Ew, tennis. No way,” Lev retorted, a disgusted look on his face. “Those racist rich white people can fuck off. Why do you even *go*? Manny has you *so* whipped,” Lev snorted at Abby derisively. “She’s not making *you* go, is she?” Lev asked, turning to look at you with his face scrunched up in disdain.

You snickered at him. “She’s not *making* me go—but I do *kindof* want to see Abby and Manny in sports-mode together,” you smirked.

Abby leaned on the tabletop, pressing both palms against its surface, and shook her head with a wry grin. “Fuckin’ Manny,” she sighed and snorted derisively herself.

“Dude, there’s *so* many fist-pumps and high-fives,” Lev said under his breath to you. “It’s *so* embarrassing.”

Lev drank up the dregs of his cereal, his mouth to the lip of the bowl. He set the bowl back down on the table with a noisy thud. “Sorryyyyy,” he apologised half-heartedly to Abby for the clatter as he wiped milk off his upper lip with the back of his hand. He stood and scampered out of the room as Abby laughed at him resignedly and took their plates to the kitchen.

Abby walked over so she was behind your chair, leaned down and let her arms fall around your neck. She bent towards you and kissed your cheek and your lips, and it was so casual, so… *easy;* like you’d been doing this for years.

“So,” she said, voice low, kissing your neck and the sensitive skin behind your ear, “Wanna… spend the rest of the day on the couch with me..?” she purred in her sultry, gravelly voice, murmuring right into your ear.

Another kiss. You felt shivers run the length of your spine, and your nipples instantly hardened.

*How could she evoke such a response with a single sentence?*

“Or maybe… in bed?” she continued, a salacious tone in her voice as she nipped at the lobe of your ear. One of her hands simultaneously snuck beneath your sweater at your hip, her fingers teasing at the waistband of your joggers.

You let out the softest sigh, nodding, and she nipped a little harder in response.

“Ew, *stop*,” Lev demanded, looking revolted. “Can’t you just wait until I’m *gone*? Geez…” he protested at Abby.

Abby laughed, and pulled back from you, turning to face Lev.

“Lev,” Abby said.

“*What?*” he said, like an annoyed kid brother.

“Thanks for looking after Bear this week. I transferred you the money this morning.”

He made a face, as if he disliked being thanked. “Ugh. Noooooo problemmmmm,” he sighed, rolling his eyes as he pulled on his ratty, well-loved Chucks in the entryway. “Oh,” he looked up at Abby, “Batting cages in the next few weeks?”

“For sure. Let me check my schedule and I’ll send through some dates.”

Lev snorted. “*Let me check my schedule*,” he mimicked her businesslike tone. “Yeah, you do that.”

“Shuddup,” she quipped back at him, shaking her head with an ever-so-slightly embarrassed smile.

He turned to you, and his demeanour totally changed. “Was cool to meet you. I like your art,” he said, nodding.

“Thanks Lev, it was great to meet you too,” you smiled, rising from your chair with a little farewell wave. “Good luck with the shoulder.”

“Yeahhh, thankssssss,” he sighed, drawling out the words in a particularly youthful show of angst. “See ya, Bear,” he called, and Bear let out a little *ruff* from where he lay sprawled on his side on the rug by the sofa. “Later,” he said to Abby with a cool sort of nod—but you noticed his little smile as he waved awkwardly at you both before turning and walking out the front door.

“And do your exercises!” Abby called after him.

You heard a resigned “Yeah, yeah, *thanks daaaaaad*,” and a loud, derisive snort from the other side of the door as his footsteps disappeared towards the elevator.

*Well, that went great!* you thought to yourself. *All that anxiety for nothing then? Thanks, brain.* You imagined the 'melting face' emoji in the back of your mind.

Abby walked towards you, immediately pulling you into a warm, enveloping hug.

“So I kinnnnnndof adore him,” you said, gushing, a broad smile on your face, as she wrapped her arms around you. “He’s… hilarious. And *so angsty.* Is he the *only* person in the whole world who’s allowed to talk to you like that? Honestly, it’s utter *perfection* to watch.”

“Pffft you can shuddup too,” Abby sassed, with a sheepish smile, freckled cheeks flushing as she cleared the plates from the table as a way to avoid your gaze. “But yeah, he’s great. And I’m honestly so damned lucky he adores Bear so much and is willing to help out with him when I’m working crazy hours.”

“So he lives on campus?”

“Yeah, but he hates it. He hates… *most* things, from what *he* says, anyway,” she smirked. “Except for space. And baseball. Though, he even says he hates most of the people on his baseball team. Buuuuut, he’s just shy, really. He’s a… a really good kid,” she finished, as she loaded the plates into the dishwasher.

You nodded quietly, and then let out an unexpected and uncontrollable yawn.

“Wannaaaaaa... come see my bedroom?” Abby asked, a hint of a lascivious smile at the corner of her lips.

“Smooth, Anderson, real subtle,” you teased.

“We can just sleep if you want?” she offered, as she walked towards you, grabbing a handful of your shirt in her fist and tugging you towards her.

“Mmmhmm, sure,” you poked her in the stomach and she tensed her abs slightly in defence, grinning as she playfully recoiled.

Abby curled her arms around you again and kissed you on the mouth, walking backwards towards the hallway to the bedroom, pulling you with her as she did so.

“How are you so gorgeous, though?” she asked breathily between kisses.

You bit your lip, looking into her sparkling blue eyes as she stared dreamily back at you.

Damn, this was gonna be one hell of a long weekend.
