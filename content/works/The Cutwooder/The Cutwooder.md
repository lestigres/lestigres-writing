## Growth Old

The light was fading faster than a squirrel in a thunderstorm, slipping through the trees and heading straight for the horizon like it was late for an appointment. And with the light, the temperature decided to play a game of "let’s make things awkward," plummeting faster than a failing math test. You’d been walking in what could only be described as _vaguely circular_ for about thirty minutes, which, by now, was enough to make you feel like a lost penguin in the woods. Earlier, the sunlight had been all sunshine and rainbows, gracing your face and filling you with delusional warmth, but now? Now it was doing its best impression of a disappearing magician.

Frustration hit you like a sack of potatoes. “Where is the trail?” you thought, genuinely wondering if the trees were conspiring against you.

It was Sunday. You had spent most of the day trying to make a _god-tier_ carving out of some wood, but it just wasn’t happening. You’d been staring at the same block of wood for hours, trying to will it into something more artistic than... well, a block of wood. So you figured you’d go for a nature walk. A nice, peaceful stroll. Only... you left way too late, and now you were apparently _five to seven miles_ from your cabin in what could only be described as _freaking nowhere._

Panic started to rise in your throat like a bad burrito. You pulled your hydration bladder tube from your backpack, took a swig, and thought, “Okay, calm down. Just figure out a way out of this. Look for signs of life. Or maybe a friendly bear that knows the way back.”

Your anxiety had a snarky comeback, though: “Signs of life? You’re in the woods, buddy. Good luck with that.”

You sighed, rolling your eyes like a teenager who just found out they had to go to math class. “Right. Look at your phone. Maybe there’s a signal now that you’re on a ridge.” You pulled it out like it was going to magically sprout reception and—NOPE. The _no signal_ icon was shining at you like a lighthouse in the middle of a storm.

“FUCK!” you muttered, squinting like you could somehow make the signal appear through sheer force of will.

“Cool,” you thought, taking a deep breath and talking yourself down. “Just find a sign of human life. Or maybe a wizard. That’d be helpful.”

You squinted through the trees, trying to get a better look. The fog was low to the ground, adding to the dramatic tension of your situation. You tapped your thigh nervously, trying to make some kind of decision. Wait a second... was that... smoke?

“SMOKE!” you yelled, a ridiculous amount of relief flooding through you. A thin column of gray was floating up from the northern slope like a smoke signal from some very chill mountain hermit. You guessed it was about a mile away—so if you hustled, you might actually make it before full-on darkness decided to creep in like an unwanted guest.

You set off like you were chasing the last bus of the night, calves screaming in protest as you charged through the twilight air. At least your muscles were getting a workout.

The cabin you’d arrived at on Friday was small, cozy, and perfect for art-making—if you didn’t count the fact that it was three hours away from Boston. The _sacrifice_ you made for creative peace. The Williamses had kindly lent it to you, and they were also the reason you had your hands on this cabin. You'd had to sneak away to Vermont like a stealthy ninja just to escape the madness of _being an adult_ for a few weeks.

So you _should_ be getting your creative genius on, right? Except, the only thing you’d been carving was your _will to live_ as you stared at your block of wood all day. Hiking was supposed to be a change of pace, but—well, here you were, somewhere between “I should’ve stayed home” and “I’m lost in the woods and probably going to die alone."

The wind was picking up, and you shivered as a tiny, freezing drop of rain splashed your cheek. You pulled your jacket tight, turning into a human burrito to shield yourself from the cold. That smoke had better be real, or you were about to lose it.

_Bingo!_ There it was again—smoke, this time billowing thicker from a cabin lower on the mountain. _Success!_ Or at least, potential success. You were about to be saved by some random person who hopefully didn’t have a collection of suspiciously sharp tools and a creepy smile.

A few minutes later, you stumbled into a clearing, feeling like the forest had been playing _peek-a-boo_ with you the whole time. The cabin was just there, sitting all pretty with its A-frame structure and green roof, like it was mocking you for being lost for so long. You were about to knock on the door when you saw her—a tall, powerful woman with an axe, splitting wood like a lumberjack superhero.

She swung the axe down with a mighty _thunk,_ her strong arms bulging as she chopped with terrifying precision. You froze. Was this... was she an axe murderer? Or maybe she was a secret agent with a weaponized axe? Either way, she was too cool for words, and you weren’t sure whether to run or try to engage in polite conversation about firewood.

She bent to grab another log, and that’s when you saw it—a long, blonde braid hanging from under her baseball cap like it was straight out of an action movie. You exhaled a sigh of relief, half-laughing to yourself. _Nope. Not an axe murderer._ Maybe just a really strong woman who could chop firewood like she was trying to win an Olympic gold medal in wood splitting.

Then the dog barked. A big, black German Shepherd came running over, tail wagging like he was auditioning for a Disney movie.

"Bear, no!" the woman shouted, snapping her fingers like she was calling a dog who could potentially cause a lot of chaos. "Come here!" Bear skidded to a stop in front of you, eyeing you like you were the snack he never asked for.

You waved awkwardly at her. “Uh, hey, sorry about your dog,” you said, hoping you didn’t look as ridiculous as you felt.

She laughed, a warm, hearty sound. "He’s just excited. Bear, down!" Bear reluctantly backed off, and the woman—still wielding the axe like it was part of her body—walked over to you, her hand outstretched for a handshake.

“Abby,” she said, smirking slightly. “And this,” she gestured to the dog, “is Bear.”

You shook her hand awkwardly, feeling like you were shaking hands with someone who could easily bench press you. Her hand was warm, solid, and firm. You were pretty sure your hand was still shaking when she let go.

"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt. I’m kinda lost,” you blurted out, still trying to process everything.

“Well, good news,” she said, raising an eyebrow. “I’m not an axe murderer. I do have spare rooms, though, if you need somewhere to stay.”

You blinked, trying to grasp the situation. Then it hit you: Abby was inviting you to her cabin to, presumably, _not_ murder you. You glanced at Bear, who had apparently decided you were _cool_ and gave you a tail wag of approval.

"That would be great, actually. Thanks," you said, trying to act normal, even though you were feeling anything but. As she led you inside, you couldn’t help but notice how... _comfortable_ everything was. Like, if cabin life had a Pinterest board, this would be it.
